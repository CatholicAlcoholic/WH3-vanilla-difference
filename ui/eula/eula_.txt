19. FOR RESIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA – BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
This Section 19 applies to you if reside in or acquired and use the Product in the United States or Canada.  
Binding Arbitration: You and SEGA (each a “party” for purposes of this Section, and collectively “the parties”) agree that all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), our relationship with each other, or your use of the Product shall be finally settled solely by binding arbitration unless the claim is within the exceptions described below. THIS AGREEMENT MEANS THAT YOU AND SEGA AGREE TO NOT HAVE SUCH CLAIMS RESOLVED IN A TRIAL BY A JUDGE OR JURY. This agreement applies to all kinds of claims, including legal, equitable, or statutory claims, under any legal theory. It also applies even after you stop using or delete, destroy, or otherwise no longer possess the Product. If you or SEGA brings a claim in court that is subject to arbitration under this section, either party can ask the court to order the parties to resolve the claim by arbitration. The arbitrator, and not a court, shall have the exclusive authority to decide whether any portion of this section is valid or enforcement, or whether it applies to a claim.
An arbitration proceeding shall be held before a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or a jury, so you and SEGA agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge or jury. An arbitration proceeding has different rules than a lawsuit in a court. For example, arbitration is less formal and usually provides for more limited information sharing between the parties in the process called discovery. After the arbitrator decides the outcome, that decision will be final and you or SEGA will generally not be able to change the outcome in a court.
This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and formation of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement.
You and SEGA agree that the arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. But if there is a conflict between this Agreement and the JAMS rules, then we will follow this Agreement. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules, but shall not incorporate the JAMS Class Action Procedures, and to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. If the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, SEGA will pay the additional cost.  The parties understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation. Each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the claims allow for to the prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees and costs, in which case the arbitrator may award them under the applicable law. If either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity of the arbitrator’s decision or award through a subsequent court case, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.
Location: The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles County, California or in the county or province where you reside. You and SEGA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  
Class Action Waiver:  The parties further agree that any arbitration or court proceeding shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  As a result:
• YOU CANNOT BRING A CLAIM AGAINST SEGA AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
• AN ARBITRATOR CANNOT COMBINE YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST SEGA WITH ANY OTHER PERSON’S CLAIMS AGAINST SEGA INTO A SINGLE CASE.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then Section 19 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.  
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate:  We agree that we each will still have the right to go to court to resolve the following claims:
• Claims about SEGA’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents).
• Claims related to piracy or tortious interference.
• Claims that are not subject to an arbitration agreement as a matter of law and are not preempted by federal law that would allow for an agreement to arbitrate.
• Claims in small claims court.

Any dispute not subject to arbitration under these exceptions shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction subject to the venue requirements described in Section 20.
30 Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Section 19 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: SEGA, 6400 Oak Canyon, Suite 100; Irvine, CA 92618; Attn. Legal & Business Affairs Department.  The notice must include the following information:
• Your full name.
• Your address.
• The name of Product you purchased and the date you purchased it or, if no purchase was made, the date that you first accessed or used the Product.
• All usernames or identifiers you use to access or use the Product, if any.
• Your signature.

The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Product (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Product and agree to these terms); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this section.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, SEGA also will not be bound by them.  
20. MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and SEGA concerning the Product and supersedes all prior agreements and representations, warranties or understandings between you and SEGA (whether negligently or innocently made but excluding those made fraudulently), regarding the same subject matter.  
If any part of the Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty, disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.  Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of the Agreement or related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
SEGA may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.  Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under the Agreement without SEGA’s express prior written consent.
SEGA’s performance of the Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Agreement is in derogation of SEGA’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Product or information provided to or gathered by SEGA with respect to such use.  In addition to any excuse provided by applicable law, we shall be excused from liability for non-delivery or delay in delivery of the Product arising from any event beyond our reasonable control, whether or not foreseeable by either party, including but not limited to, labour disturbance, war, terrorism, fire, denial of service attack, internet outages, accident, adverse weather, inability to secure transportation, governmental act or regulation, and other causes or events beyond our reasonable control, whether or not similar to those which are enumerated above.
Nothing in this Agreement gives or claims to give to any third party any benefit or right to enforce any term of this Agreement, and the provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (as amended or modified from time to time) are expressly excluded.
The parties agree that all correspondence relating to this Agreement shall be written in the English language.
This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relates to it shall be construed under laws of England and Wales, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts. If you reside in or purchased and use the Product in the United States or Canada any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California of the United States of America without regard to conflict of law provisions. If you are a resident of the United States or Canada, the United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver provisions of Section 19.

In order to protect SEGA, the Product, any third-party licensors that have licensed intellectual property to SEGA for use in the Product, and users that create Mods, the following terms apply (“Modding Terms”). Please review these rules carefully before you create, share, distribute, use or otherwise exploit any Mods.

Please note that SEGA prohibits the creation of Mods for certain games. This may be due to third party licensing issues which prevent SEGA from allowing its users to create Mods. In such instances, you shall not be entitled to create Mods for that Product and the Modding Terms shall not apply.
You can find out which Products allow for the creation of Mods by visiting the applicable Modding Page (as defined below). If you are unsure as to whether the creation of Mods is prohibited for your Product, please contact SEGA’s Customer Service Department (customersupportuk@sega.co.uk). Please note that laws in your respective jurisdiction may require that you are of a certain age in order to enter into legally binding arrangements such as the Modding Terms. In the event that you are under the required age, you may not create any Mods, unless your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms. The licence we provide to you to create and use Mods with the Product may be revoked if you breach the Modding Terms.
1. OWNERSHIP 
You acknowledge that you shall have no ownership or other proprietary interest in the Product and/or any Mods which you create, except as expressly stated herein. Any Mods that you create shall belong to you only insofar as the Mod contains your original creative work. You acknowledge and agree that all right, title and interest in any elements of the Mod which represent, comprise, derive or are based upon any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Product (including but not limited to any computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialogs, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, images, animation, sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects or text), including without limitation copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual properties therein and/or related thereto, whether or not registered or registrable, are owned by, or for the benefit of  SEGA and its licensors. 

You shall not be entitled to any compensation for the creation of Mods except as part of a separate express agreement between you and SEGA. You also agree that SEGA may use the Mod in any manner it deems appropriate. 


2. LICENCE
Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of the SEGA EULA and the Modding Terms, SEGA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, fully revocable right and licence to install, access and use the in-game modding tools, any graphical assets and/or other related tools provided by SEGA (“Modding Tools”) solely and exclusively to create Mods for use with the Product and to publish those Mods on the applicable SEGA approved third party Modding webpage for the Product (“Modding Libraries”). Please note that certain Modding Libraries may be owned and operated by third parties such as Valve (https://store.steampowered.com/), EPIC (https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/) and mod.io https://mod.io/  (collectively, the “Third Party Platforms”) and may be subject to additional terms and conditions published by those Third Party Platforms. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Modding Tools is at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any obligations, damages or losses which arise from your registration, access and use of the Modding Tools. 

You agree to use the Modding Tools to create Mods in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement, and with any additional terms and conditions published by the Third Party Platforms, including an agreement that you shall not sell, rent, lease, licence, distribute or otherwise transfer or exploit the Modding Tools and/or Mods or any copies thereof, for commercial gain or otherwise, except as permitted by this Agreement and/or the Third Party Platforms. A breach of the provisions of this licence shall constitute a material breach which has the effect of terminating the SEGA EULA (including the Modding Terms) and which may subject you to civil and criminal liability.

In consideration of the above grant of rights, you hereby grant SEGA, its affiliates, its licensors and any Third Party Platforms all the necessary consents, clearances and an irrevocable, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual licence and right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, display, distribute or otherwise exploit any Mod which is uploaded to the Modding Libraries in any way SEGA and/or any Third Party Platforms see fit for use with the Product. You waive and agree never to assert against SEGA or its affiliates, licensors, or the Third Party Platforms any moral rights or similar rights, however designated, that you may have in or to any Mods.

3. CONTENT RESTRICTIONS
Any element which you include in your Mod (except for the Modding Tools) must be your own original work created by you or you must have obtained the necessary permissions to use such materials. You are responsible for the content of any Mods which you create and publish on the Modding Libraries and shall warrant and represent to SEGA and any Third Party Platform that your Mods do not contain:
1. any materials which are discriminatory, racist, obscene, libelous, offensive, illegal, defamatory, inappropriate, invasive, or likely to adversely affect the reputation or goodwill of SEGA and/or its licensors;

2. any resemblance to any recognisable third party brand, character or personality, including but not limited to any trademark, logos or third party assets except for those assets provided to you by SEGA within the Modding Tools as necessary for the creation of the Mod for use with the Product;

3. any assets from other games published by SEGA and its affiliates or any other third party without permission, where such use constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights;

4. any materials which do not comply with any additional instructions provided to you by SEGA and/or the Third Party Platforms as published on the Modding Libraries or within the Modding Tools, which may be updated by SEGA and/or the Third Party Platforms from time to time;

5. any malicious code, including viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, corrupted data, or other content that contains malicious code or in any way damages or interfere with the operation of the Product.
SEGA does not pre-vet or monitor any Mods which are uploaded to the Modding Libraries and does not monitor, endorse or approve any Mods. You are solely responsible for your Mod and may be held liable for any Mod which you create and upload to the Modding Libraries. SEGA and the Third Party Platforms reserve the right, in their sole and final discretion, to remove, disable, block, edit or move any Mods from the Modding Libraries for any reason in its sole discretion including if SEGA determines the Mods violates this Agreement. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, SEGA does not assume any responsibility or liability for the Mods or for removal of Mods, or any failure or delay in removing such Mods. 
4. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold SEGA and its parent companies, affiliates, licensors, licensees, contractors, officers, directors, employees, agents and the Third Party Platforms harmless from any damages, losses, cost and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising directly or indirectly from any acts and omissions associated with the use of any Mod which you create and publish, including but not limited to any allegation that the Mod violates the copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party, or any other violation of these terms.

Your grant of the licence to SEGA to use any Mods which you create and publish to the Modding Libraries shall survive termination.

Because SEGA would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that SEGA shall be entitled to take such action as may be required, including seeking an injunction and other equitable remedies, in addition to any other remedies available to it under the applicable law.
