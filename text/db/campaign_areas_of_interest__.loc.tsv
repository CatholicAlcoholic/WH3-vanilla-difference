campaign_areas_of_interest_description_wh3_main_ie_barrier_idols	Strange rituals are performed by the local Savage Orcs beneath large but crude dung-smeared totems.

campaign_areas_of_interest_description_wh3_main_ie_estalian_tomb	The remains of Estalian kings and their royal retinues once lay in peace in the earth. Now their souls know no rest, for an opportunistic Necromancer is always in need of the greatest Undead warriors.	false

campaign_areas_of_interest_description_wh3_main_ie_gouger_gully	An otherwise unremarkable chasm in the ground exposes an old Underway route much trodden upon by Dwarfs, Greenskins and Skaven, and now more sinister figures both Undead and Daemonic.	false

campaign_areas_of_interest_description_wh3_main_ie_pillar_of_bone	A powerful Storm of Magic once whipped up a great arcane fulcrum from the ground, a supernatural pillar seemingly made of solid bone.
