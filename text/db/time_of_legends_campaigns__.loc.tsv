time_of_legends_campaigns_localised_description_wh3_main_tol_darkness_and_disharmony	There is great unrest in Grand Cathay – an era known as the Time of Darkness and Disharmony. The Dragon Emperor and Moon Empress have been missing for over a century. As their children bicker in the power vacuum, Cathay’s enemies take advantage. In the south, the Monkey King seizes territories he would never have dared had the Dragon Emperor been in residence at the Celestial Palace. And across the realms, the cults of Chi’an Chi rise in power to cause internal strife and pull apart the already strained relations between the Dragon siblings. Yet, the greatest threat comes – as it always has done – from north of the Great Bastion.	false
