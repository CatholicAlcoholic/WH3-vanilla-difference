battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_skv_tretch_craventail_lucky_skullhelm_stage_5	The Greenskins of the Madmoonz tribe are entangled in a Skaven plot to destroy Clan Rictus. The notoriously lucky Tretch, however, is a master schemer himself and has uncovered the plot. Unable to move against the Council of Thirteen members behind the scheme, he is determined to make an example of the hapless Madmoonz. He advances on their underground lair in the far north, determined to take the skull of the tribal leader for himself as an emblem of his uncanny fortune.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_arkhan_the_staff_of_nagash_stage_5_staff_of_nagash	Settra must have discovered Arkhan's quest for the Staff of Nagash, for he has gifted it to a Skaven warlord in return for the Liche King's destruction. Arkhan faces a desperate fight indeed, though if he succeeds, the staff will be his to wield at last!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_arkhan_the_tomb_blade_of_arkhan_stage_4_mortuary_of_tzulaqua	Arkhan has located the Lizardmen responsible for looting Alcadizaar's tomb. They are attempting to resurrect the Nehekharan warrior-king themselves, denying Arkhan the soul he so desperately seeks to empower his ancient Tomb Blade. They know too much, they dare too much - this ends here!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	The books, along with the Necromancer’s staff, have awoken the Black Pyramid. And so the carrion circle. The Tomb Kings have always lusted for power in life and especially in death. Settra comes, leading an undying alliance to wrest the pyramid from its creator’s most loyal servant. The Followers of Nagash raise their warriors even as the Black Pyramid climbs into the sky. The battle for its control is about to begin.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_khalida	The five books are found. The Liche Priests begin the ultimate incantation, igniting the power within the stirring Black Pyramid. Nagash’s ultimate legacy is ripe for domination. However, the Arch-Necromancer’s greatest lackey, the Liche King, has deployed his legions and lieutenants to defend the master’s shrine. \\n\\nArkhan himself remains mysteriously absent… for now.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_khalida_venom_staff_stage_3_ash_river	Khalida arrays her forces at a crossing on the Ash River. A large Undead army, led by the cursed Lahmian Vampires, marches west towards the Black Pyramid of Nagash, no doubt with nefarious intent. On the opposite bank of the river, the cavalry vanguard of the vampires marches to cross the river. The time is nigh. Asaph has her champion, and she shall have her vengeance!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_khatep_the_liche_staff_stage_5_pits_of_zardok	Khatep and his retinue enter the pitch dark tomb, and in a stroke, the terrible truth is revealed. Before his army, a ravening horde of Beastmen stretches, ready to charge - and at their backs, the Priests of Nagash. Treachery! The trail of breadcrumbs… the false litany... the lure of redemption - it is all an elaborate deception, fiendishly wrought to tantalise him, to draw him to this place and to his destruction. As the pieces fall into place in Khatep’s mind, his outrage is consumed in the white heat of fury. The foul apostates will pay with their souls – as will their beast-kin thralls!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_settra_the_blessed_blade_of_ptra_stage_3_charnel_valley	Settra arrives at the reliquary, only to encounter a combined force of Humans and Dwarfs preparing to desecrate the site and thieve away his sacred blade. For such an affront, their souls are forfeit!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_settra_the_crown_of_nehekhara_stage_5_pack_ice_bay	Settra's force has located those in possession of the Crown of Nehekhara. Possibly thinking that the crown will protect them from the Imperishable’s unending wrath, they are hidden in a forested area, from which they believe a trap can be sprung. They are, of course, wrong.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_def_hellebron_deathsword_and_the_cursed_blade_stage_4_altar_of_ultimate_darkness	Druchii under Morathi's dominion intercept the Blood Queen's retinue. Hellebron is unconcerned, for the time of murder is at hand, and for every enemy throat severed and dedicated to Khaine her twin blades will find their edge once more. Yet… this battle – like all the events leading up to it – is of Morathi's machinations. Nothing should be taken as it seems.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_hef_alarielle_star_of_avelorn_stage_5	Secrecy and stealth are the Everqueen's allies as her war host seeks to take the higher ground and gain a key tactical advantage against the mortal servants of the Dark Gods. The enemy has placed his artillery forces on a hill to the east. How the Everqueen deals with them will be the key to unlocking victory.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_hef_alith_anar_the_moon_bow_stage_4	Even though Alith Anar walks into this willingly, the battle is still a trap. The Shadow King must use all of Loec's tricks to evade capture and make the Dark Elves pay for this brazen and doomed act. Like the shadows the king and his warriors are named after, the Asur must remain evasive and not get pinned down, for that is when the Dark Elves might actually get the upper hand.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_10	Glorious! The Beast of Raema is just as the legends proclaim - the creature's many heads will make perfect trophies and a worthy sacrifice to the Dark Gods. Its Beastmen acolytes bray with a madness you have not seen in the Cloven Ones before, so be wary when tackling them. But enough posturing - the hunt nears its end and there is a monster to slay!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_11	Through the stinking, cramped tunnels you go and then finally you emerge at Seep-Gore, lair of the Hellbeast. The creature lumbers forward, its straining abdomen appearing to pulse as if barely constraining the hordes within its distended belly.\\n\\nThe monster is truly is an abomination! Its heads will make many trophies and a worthy dedication to the Dark Gods... Kill it!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_8	Despite the Shifting Isles, you arrive in time, as the volcano growls. Assuming the snivelling Druchii told the truth, the Mother of the Flame will rise from Vaul's Anvil at any moment. Then, you see the High Elves deploy their Dragon Princes and Phoenix Guard - warriors sent to guard this mythical creature and a sure sign that this is indeed the right time.\\n\\nBreak them apart to claim victory. This bird will make a perfect sacrifice!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_9	After endless days trudging through the jungle, your warband arrives at a great temple scattered with the bones of beasts and other prey. It is a feeding ground. You turn to ask the Skink if this is the place to bait a trap, but the reptile has gone! All that remains is a shackle containing a foot gnawed through at the ankle. It seems the trap is not yours to set - for you are the bait!\\n\\nA great roar rumbles across the clearing, the ground shakes, birds scatter from the lush canopies, and the usually-loud jungle is suddenly silent... until pierced by another roar. Then, from the trees, a chanting is heard "Gargantulzan! Gargantulzan! Gargantulzan!"\\n\\nThe behemoth has arrived, and you must now fight a Carnosaur of legend!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_aranessa_saltspite_krakens_bane	What started out as a hunt to punish some Norscans for murdering Manann's creatures has now become an emotionally-charged family affair. Aranessa may have been born Norscan, but her allegiance has always been to the sea. Rejected and betrayed by her own flesh and blood as a baby, she now has a chance to appease the bitterness raging eternally inside her.\\n\\nThe Skjold chieftain claiming to be her birth father has just launched a raid against Pack Ice Bay. Aranessa vows that no more innocent creatures of the sea shall die in her name – this ends now!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_cylostra_shifting_isles_battle_bretonnia	It has been many years since Madame Cylostra was the favoured court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a distinction she intends to have once more. Having spotted a galleon of Bretonnian troops disembarked on a nearby island, she has little time to waste. If she can get close enough, she will give them the show of a lifetime and remind them what they’ve been missing all these years!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_final_battle	All three verses of the Lost Sea Shanty have been discovered and sung, unleashing the Invocations of Potency hidden within the lyrics. At last, the Star-metal Harpoon now has the power to slay the Merwyrm known as Amanar, but there is one who has been following this ill-gotten quest since the beginning, one whose ship has been stalking yours from afar on the horizon; now you are poised to strike, he steps forward to claim the prize for himself.\\n\\nYou are merely interlopers, for the sea-beast allies itself to the High Elves, who are the mortal enemies of your stalker.

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_harkon	The Lizardmen may have taken their enchanted gold back, but Luthor Harkon is already closing in. The wily pirate has spies all around the Vampire Coast's borders and on its outlying islets, so a Lizardmen army of such a vast size could not simply move around Lustria without him hearing of their whereabouts. He knows precisely where the gold is, and now it is his for the taking - anything that gets in his way will be swiftly dealt with, for death comes to all who oppose the Pirate King!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial	The map that came into Count Noctilus’ possession is no trap – it has led him to an unchartered island in the Great Ocean where the treasure chest containing Captain Roth’s Moondial is located. As he approaches the island, however, it appears his map is not the only one in existence – a large army of treasure-hunting soldiers of fortune has somehow found its way there ahead of him and pitched camp at the top of a hill. Before the day is out, Noctilus will surely have made yet more of the dead to raise into his Undead ranks!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_qb_def_lokhir_fellheart_helm_of_the_kraken	While the Blessed Dread is docked, the Skaven strike! Their sorcerous leader believes they have weakened the Krakenlord, and while he licks his wounds and pride in port, the ratmen will take the spoils and infamy for themselves. But they could not be more wrong... they are not the hunters but the hunted! Fellheart knew the creature that cursed his helm would attempt an incursion here, so his crew lay in wait for the Skaven thieves to board. Afore the day is done, Fellheart shall sluice the decks in ratblood and restore the Helm of the Kraken to its former lustre!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_great_vortex_kroqgar_lord_kroak_stage_3	There are few potential proponents of the Lizardmen’s cause more powerful than the venerable Lord Kroak, Deliverer of Itza. Said to have been taught the ways of the Winds of Magic by the Old One known as Tepok, the stoking of Kroak's relics into an active state will likely have a profound effect on the fulfilment of the Great Plan. Currently existing as a shrivelled and lifeless husk mummified in wrappings, some vestige of power still resides in him still, a distant echo of former glory, yet strength enough to unleash destruction upon his enemies. Yet now he sits vulnerable from the Skaven menace and must be protected at all costs.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek_stage_6	Even during times of war, the Lizardmen are known for being cold, emotionless killers, but not Tehenhauin. As Sotek’s chosen, his sole purpose is to punish the Skaven, and he has done so with unrelenting zeal and brutality. Readying his apostles at Gwakmol Crater, the Prophet knows that whether or not victory is achieved, the path of the Prophet will not end there, for the Skaven and the Lizardmen are perennial - nay, eternal - enemies. The Winds carry whispers that these events may have unfolded before, and may yet unfold again. In any case, the Cult of Sotek have heeded the words of the Prophecy. Today, these ratmen must die – all of them!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_lzd_tiktaqto_mask_of_heavens_stage_5	Using his aerial mobility, Tiktaq'to has successfully tracked a large Skaven presence to a temple location where the Geomantic Web is emanating clear signs of deterioration.  Having already sent some of his squadron to reconnoitre the area, he knows the place to be crawling with the abominable ratmen, although it seems not all of them are immediately visible on the battlefield, at least from his elevated vantage point. There must be more of them around somewhere, ready to scurry out from their squalid burrows, but Tiktaq'to is unconcerned. For he is the peerless, fearless Master of Skies!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_qb_skv_ikit_claw_storm_daemon_stage_4	With the construction of his Warpstone Tractor Beam, Ikit Claw has really outdone himself. Needless to say, any plan involving the invention of a device to pull giant chunks of Warpstone down from orbit could only be thought up by an individual both deranged and brilliant in equal abundance. Whether or not Ikit will see his original plan through to the end and corrupt the Lizardmen’s spawning pools, he isn’t going to let any of the fallen Warpstone go to waste, and those pesky Lizard-things better not get in his way either. If they do, they will find themselves at the wrong end of his deadly Storm Daemon!	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	Lustria’s jungles burn. Its temple-cities crumble. Under Markus Wulfhart’s command, the Emperor’s forces have wreaked havoc in the New World, wantonly plundering the lucrative holdings of the lizard-beasts while sweeping aside all foes sent against them. But now, the most monstrous of them of all has been roused.\\n\\nWulfhart's scouts have informed him that the creature known as the Spirit of the Jungle has been sighted somewhere in the vicinity of Itza. The Huntsmarshal has caught the scent; this will be his toughest hunt yet.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	One by one, Nakai fought off the so-called great hunters in cahoots with the Huntsmarshal. And one by one, they fled into the jungle like the warm-blooded cowards they are. Nakai correctly sensed they would be back for more, and now the chief warmblood himself, Markus Wulfhart, takes to the field with them. Lustria’s future hangs in the balance, for why else would Nakai be so compelled to act? This conflict ends now!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_vor_lzd_nakai_golden_tributes_stage_3	Itza is under siege. The ancient bastion is perhaps the toughest of the Lizardmen's temple-cities to penetrate for any attacker, but Luthor Harkon has already managed to breach its walls using his renowned eldritch artillery. His advance force of zombie crewmen are already closing in ahead of him, along with some pestiferous Skaven reinforcements. Nakai may not understand why these pathetic creatures seek to defile the sacred First City, but the Wanderer is nonetheless consumed by a simple, overwhelming urge to crush them all to a bloody, even-more-lifeless pulp.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_vor_lzd_nakai_the_ogham_shard_stage_2	On the rain-soaked marshes of Albion, Nakai primes himself for battle. A distant memory seems to linger in his primitive mind... a vague familiarity with his surroundings that the warmbloods might call 'déjà vu'. Had the Old Ones guided him to this place before in a previous era? As a Kroxigor Ancient, Nakai knows not his own age, nor does he really understand his purpose, but he is consumed by it. Whatever the Ancient Enemy are planning, Nakai knows the puppets they’ve sent to this sacred place must die immediately.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_vortex_emp_wulfhart_amber_bow_stage_4	With the lifeless expressions of the slain settlers still fresh in his mind, the Huntsmarshal readies himself for some blood-soaked vengeance. His expedition had moved swiftly through the jungle with collective determination, hoping to prevent another catastrophe in the Lustrian colonies. This time, they were not too late. Markus was never one to take the merciless slaughter of his innocent kin very well, but had never let his anger overcome him on the battlefield before, and wasn’t going to now. These cold-blooded beasts will get the cold-blooded death that they deserve!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_vortex_gorrok_the_shield_of_aeons_stage_3	Gor-Rok’s arrival at Itza was a timely one. Luthor Harkon, the self-proclaimed king of the Vampire Coast, has somehow managed to wrangle together an eldritch army consisting not only of his rotting, Undead pirate crew, but also a cohort of verminous, screeching Skaven. Strongly sensing the danger, Gor-Rok positions himself within the great temple-city’s walls, undeterred by the approach of Harkon’s foul, rag-tag force. Whatever the insane Vampire has bribed the ratmen with, it’s likely that he plans to claim Itza’s powerful artefacts for himself, and will kill anything that gets in his way. There’s one thing he hadn’t counted on, however – the Great White Lizard is extremely hard to kill!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_qb_def_final_battle_malus	As Malus prepares to return to Naggaroth aboard his Black Ark it seems that Clan Eshin have other plans and have gathered to intercept him. The recent murderous attentions of the assassin-brood had not been as random and as senseless as they appeared – it is the Daemon they want, but they must know as well as Malus does that they are going to have to kill him to get it. Malus had heard of the ratman assassin Deathmaster Snikch, but now has the feeling that he may be about to get much more closely acquainted with him…	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	The mysterious power that Snikch has been sent after has turned out to be far more potent than he could have imagined. The Deathmaster might even consider the consequences of keeping it for himself – with such dark, powerful energies at his disposal, no being, mortal or otherwise, would be beyond the reach of his assassination attempts! Before that, however, Snikch still has to kill the Elf-thing who wields the Daemon before he can make a cowardly escape aboard his Black Ark…	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_vor_def_malus_warpsword_of_khaine_stage_4	To sate the thirst of the legendary Warpsword of Khaine, Malus must face the horrors that await him in the Chaos Wastes. All the while, his self-control waxes and wanes with the torment of Daemonic rage that bubbles within him. He was always arrogant and ambitious, even by Druchii standards, but his curse has convinced him that no foe can best him, and especially not today. The blade has already tasted Chaos-tainted blood – by the time the battle is over, it will be glutted with it!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_vortex_brt_repanse_defend_or_conquer_crusader_stage_1	Repanse has felt the Lady’s influence once again, ever guiding her towards the annihilation of the unholy evils of the world. Deep in the desert, beyond the Great Mortis Delta, priests of the dead have already started to ceremonially circumambulate the malevolent ebony symbol known as the Black Pyramid. Repanse regards the structure as no mere temple, but the very beating heart of the evil that blights these sand-strewn lands. The Tomb Kings’ purpose for it is unclear, but her gut instinct tells her that whatever the ritual being enacted, they must all be cut down.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_vortex_brt_repanse_defend_or_conquer_guardian_stage_1	Just off the coast of Repanse’s beloved home dukedom of Lyonesse, the Undead pirates of the sea gather and lurk. The most infamous eldritch admirals of the world have long been enticed to plunder the hoarded wealth of the Land of Chivalry, now consolidating their fleets to mount a massive invasion. There are two things the foul flotilla of creatures did not count on, however – the depth of Repanse’s unwavering piety, and her undeniable favour from the Lady, which shall surely propel her to victory once again!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_vortex_brt_repanse_sword_of_lyonesse_stage_4	Even far from home, Repanse continues to answer her divine calling, for the Lady of the Lake demands all Undead abominations be vanquished wherever they may be found. After a tough journey into the Atalan Mountains, the Chevaliers have made a timely arrival. The Dwarfs, though well accustomed to the struggle against the evils of the desert, find themselves in grave need of Repanse’s help. The Damoiselle de Guerre will oblige; after all, if the honourable do not fight shoulder-to-shoulder against the evils of the world, what chance do the forces of good have?	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_vortex_skv_snikch_the_cloak_of_shadows_stage_4	The ratling fool who thought he could get away with stealing from Snikch has been found, and must be moved upon before he can hightail it from his mountaintop hideout. Whatever the nature of the thief’s mysterious ally, they too will meet their end if they dare oppose Eshin's greatest Master Assassin. After all, the Cloak of Shadows is no two-bit garment for a low-life scrounger – it belongs on the back of the Deathmaster himself!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_hef_imrik_armour_of_caledor	Brazenly challenged by a Blood Dragon Vampire, Imrik primes himself to fight for his ancestors’ honour. The Dragon Prince’s scouts have scoured the deserted island chosen by the fiend to be the location of the battle. They report that even now, the Vampire dons the gauntlet that once belonged to Caledor the First.

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_qb_grn_final_battle_grom	Grom marched through the Yvraine Plain where the Elves had made a futile stand against him all those years ago. This time, they cowered within Tor Yvresse. Grom found himself salivating – possibly because he hadn’t eaten in the last ten minutes, but mainly at the thought of conquering the pointy-‘eads great city at long last. Eltharion, the Elf-git who repelled his first invasion and beheaded his Shaman, would be waiting for him. Grom was going to chop him up and burn the city to the ground, just in time for dinner.	false

Turns out this little soirée was all part of someone’s complex plan to stoke up Goblin rivalries, first by swapping Grom’s axe with a counterfeit, then by spreading rumours about a rival Goblin, Git Guzzler, to bring them both to battle.\\n\\nGrom is unmoved, however – whoever this rotten mastermind is, the Goblin King will smash all his rivals and end this battle royale, reclaiming his axe and proving once and for all that he is the biggest, bestest gobbo!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_qb_hef_eltharion_talisman_of_hoeth_stage_3	The goal of the heinous forces of Chaos is clear. They want the destruction of the ancient Waystones, an act that would leave Ulthuan exposed and disrupt the flow of the Winds of Magic into the Great Vortex. Not only would the Elves’ island-haven be overrun by Daemonic evil, but Chaos would eventually be able to manifest freely and unabated across the entire world. This is the Warden’s burden; he has no choice but to answer his calling and stop them at all costs.	false

The city’s defence against the Goblin King’s insatiable attentions is his sworn duty, just as it was his father’s before him. But this was personal. He suddenly remembered that Grom’s first invasion had caused the deaths of his family members, his brother grislily hacked apart by the obese Goblin himself. Today, duty and vengeance would both be accomplished. There would be no escape for the Paunch. 	false

His successes in creating foul abominations were testament to the fact that his affliction had never made him any less of a Master Mutator, but the opportunity to finally cure his ravenous disposition was too good to pass up. The tree-thing informant had spoken the truth – a veritable demigoddess now stands vulnerable before him, conjuring some inconsequential spell. All that remains is to capture her, grind her into a pulp, and consume her!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_throt_whip_of_domination	Bloodthirsty Warriors of Chaos surround the fleshy walls of Hell Pit, nightmarish stronghold of Skaven Clan Moulder. Their frenzied presence at its corpse-adorned gates prevents fresh shipments of Rat-Ogres and other such abominations from reaching other clans. The rival Rat Lords have paid handsomely for these monstrous recruits – should Moulder fail to meet its obligations, the reprisals will be severe. As his greatest creation, the Rat-Ogre/man hybrid Ghoritch, has thus far failed to drive off the invading horde, Master Mutator Throt resolves to obliterate these servants of the Dark Gods himself.	false

The Wildwood Rangers have been alerted to her presence and have already moved to intercept her. Now, Drycha must battle her way through the wilderness to free the embittered Ancient from his leafy confinement.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	Though the Great Vortex stifles Daemonkind, a rift in the Witchwood provides Chaos with another passageway into the world. Ariel, demigoddess of the Asrai and avatar of Isha, channels all her power to seal the portal, hoping to prevent the Daemons of the Dreaming Wood from entering the mortal plane. Somehow, the scheming Skaven know the Mage Queen is vulnerable, and are preparing to attack. The Sisters of Twilight must dispatch them before they can disrupt Ariel’s efforts and bring cataclysm to the world.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_sisters_dragon	Naestra and Arahan approach Witchwood Hollow with caution. Though their Forest Dragon was purportedly taken alive, the involvement of the Beastmen is a cause of great concern for the twin maidens. Ceithin-Har is a powerful and majestic beast, more than capable of taking care of itself, but somehow it has been rendered vulnerable, likely by some Dark Magic. There is no doubt in the sisters’ minds that the foul Children of Chaos are up to some fell ritual, and that their Dragon companion is in great danger!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc17_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	The place known as the Heart of the Dark is a destination never spoken of, but the way to the malignant monolith at its centre is always revealed to those who have the Dark Gods’ favour. Even their Ruinous plan to bring about another Coming of Chaos through the power of the mighty Herdstone matters little to the Brass Bull, for he wishes only to be given the power to rampage eternally and feed his perpetual Bloodgreed. Enemies abound as rivals also seek such power, while ancient foes stalk in the shadows.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc17_qb_bst_taurox_rune_tortured_axes	Once a year, the Witch Elves descend onto the streets of their cities in unbridled celebration of murder – this is Death Night. Arriving on the city outskirts, the Brass Bull observes the blood-red smog emanating from the twisted mansions, a sight that heightens his bloodlust even more. The roaming bands of Witch Elves have begun their murder spree, but gain wind of Taurox’s presence outside. It seems that he is now the guest of honour and the Druchii waste no time in spilling outside the gates to intercept him.	false

It is time for the old ways to be proven superior once and for all.	false

He has arrived just in the nick of time – the blasted Skaven have already arrived and are forcing their way into the vault, eager to pilfer whatever they can find inside. To claim what is rightfully the Dawi’s, Thorek must dispatch these rats, and quickly. Further chittering echoes through the surrounding caves, so they are likely not alone.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_dlc17_qb_lzd_final_battle_oxyotl	Driven by his staunch resolve, Oxyotl has shadowed Taurox right into the centre of the Heart of the Dark. It is an infernal place that has haunted his visions, where few souls other than the Beastmen come. Those not of the Cloven Ones that do usually die a sacrificial death, fed into the gaping maw at the great Herdstone’s base. Fell energies saturate the air, a portent that Chaos’ foul plan is on the verge of fruition with the Brass Bull at the heart of it. It is time to end his rampages once and for all.	false

The Northmen approach, likely expecting to meet with the slave traders from Ghrond once again to receive more foul relics, an outcome the Chameleon Skink has already ensured will not come to pass. He must now send a message that there will always be consequences for those who worship the Dark Gods and handle their tainted goods. A hail of deadly darts awaits!	false

They are not alone, however, as scouts report that Teclis has arrived to support his brother. Taking advantage of the situation, Malekith orders his expendable vanguard to take the brunt of Tyrion’s army, pinning down the enemy and paving the way for victory.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh2_main_qb_def_malekith_supreme_spellshield_stage_3_mosquito_swamps	The Witch King has come upon the Mosquito Swamps and sees that they are guarded by Lizardmen. The reptiles are an annoyance that must be fought if Malekith is to claim back his Spellshield. He calls out to the Dark Elves Captain Strenious has hidden to ambush him, telling them that they will now work for him or face his wrath. It is now the Lizardmen that face an ambush.	false

Should the colony be taken the High Elf defenders are under no illusion as to what their fates will be, and so prepare to fight like trapped vermin!	false

The volcano rages all around, as if it knows that battle is inevitable. Teclis has sent word to his brother, but has no notion where Tyrion is or if he will even answer the summons. And so the High Loremaster must face the forces of the Witch King alone, but he is not afraid, for he is Teclis, Defender of Ulthuan!	false

Whether the creatures were in league with Terrorgheist all along, or are just rampant opportunists, it does not matter. What is far more important is that the War Crown is returned to its rightful owner. The Skaven may have Teclis and his host surrounded, but the ratmen must now deal with one of the most powerful mages to ever have lived!	false

But the volcano is not the best battlefield for the attacker - its narrow confines mean the advantage is with the defender. Although, an enemy as desperate as the Druchii will not think twice before committing sufficient numbers to ensure Tyrion’s defeat!	false

Tyrion finds himself accused of Dark Elf sympathies by the Loremasters - it matters little that this situation has been brought about by the intrigues of selfish princes jealous of Tyrion’s influence over the Phoenix King. For now, swords have been drawn and blood must indeed be spilt! Tyrion must expect to face powerful magic and ranks of elite Swordmasters.	false

For such a heinous transgression, the Elves must be punished as decreed by the Lord of Solar-City. The gates are surrounded by a deep crevasse that must be crossed before the Asur are truly engaged.

The ratmen must be destroyed and the Cobra Mace reclaimed, but the Skink attendants note caution as the Skaven have hauled large catapults ashore, giving them considerable firepower. They have no consideration for the safety of their countless underlings - as well as being armed to the teeth, the Skaven are also willing to sacrifice their slaves whilst their artillery is brought to bear. The Lizardmen must also be wary, for the Rat-spawn are the sneakiest of tricksters in this world and will almost certainly attempt to outflank their Saurus warriors in a most underhand way!	false

But the Lizardmen are aware of Skrolk’s movements and have been tracking their nemesis since his recent slaughter of their spawn-kin. The time for inaction is over. The isle is a sacred place, for the Old Ones once roamed there. To let the Rat-spawn enter the island’s interior is unthinkable, so the foes meet upon the beach…	false

He sends his horde forth and they scamper around the bloated corpses of the Man-things, towards the Liber Bubonicus. But then the corpses start to stir, and rise to fight once again. Some ancient reptilian enchantment has been activated, and now Skrolk must fight those he has already killed!	false

They seek to relieve Rakarth of his newly-acquired creatures, and free them to return to the jungles from which they were taken. Ambushing the Black Ark, they gather in numbers, fearless under the leadership of their revered general. Now Rakarth must defend his prize, and lay waste to the Lizardmen army, sending a clear message to all who would think to stand between him and his monstrous treasures.	false

Readying his forces, Azazel revels in the chance to punish their ambition, for he stands on the precipice of eternal glory, and none shall rob him of it. Delivering such a prize would surely secure his place as the Prince of Pleasure's ecstatic right hand, and only the false champions that challenge him stand in his way. It is well past time they were eliminated!	false

The Dark Prince’s second-in-command is unaccustomed to being a pawn in the plans of others, yet the opportunity to reap Elven souls is not something any acolyte of the Dark Gods would pass up. Besides, the aloof Prince of Damnation cannot help but be impressed by the lengths the Hag Queen has gone to for such a worthy sacrifice to the God of Excess.

As he shuffles between noisome fungoid and carnivorous vine, a delightful sight marauds into view – a rambunctious Brayherd of lost (but very angry) Beastmen. It not only has Cygors in its ranks – creatures whose cycloptic, magic-seeing eyes Festus has long sought to harvest – but also Jabberslythes, whose vitriolic bile will have myriad uses in his foul alchemy. This will be quite the autopsy!	false

To secure such a bounty for Tzeentch would surely elevate the Master of Misrule as the Changer's greatest champion. Yet the stirrings of a vision tug at Vilitch's mind — a warning of great danger — for another unforeseen power may yet desire the Altar's prize for his own!	false

Yet upon his arrival, another portal has manifested, from which the dazed forces of the Empire and the East spill forth. These pathetic mortals must be eradicated in Tzeentch's name, for his plotting has changed their fates forever, and each one of them is surely destined to die by the Curseling's hand.	false

Much more noteworthy is that it is led by a particularly hard and militaristic Black Orc. It seems the Dawi-Zharr’s own creation has come back to take his revenge! Luckily, Zhatan is not so easily swayed by such a foe, which is precisely why the Conclave chose him to tidy up this unruly mess.	false

Yet an ancient rivalry threatens the achievement; the armies of the Old One's march on Wei-Jin, ready to halt the ritual by force before their precious Great Plan can be subverted. In response, Yuan Bo has rallied his own men. He will defend the city at all cost, for the ritual must be completed if the rule of the Dragons is ever to be secured.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_cth_yuan_bo_dragons_fang	Yuan Bo sends forth his eyes and ears, using the considerable talents of the agents under his command to pinpoint those responsible for the desecration of Cathayan land and life. The signs are indisputable, a Daemon Prince of Nurgle is responsible for these heinous crimes, but it cannot be acting alone.\\n\\nA trio of alchemists, absent from their posts, have been confirmed as the collaborators. The Jade Dragon has long suspected these unsanctioned practitioners of magic, willing as they are to flout the laws of the realm. They flee before their rightful justice, retreating with their new master through a gateway to the hideous realm of Nurgle.	false

The Coven thinks they have Ostankya trapped, each hoping to take a piece of the Hag Mother's magic for themselves. Yet, Ostankya has other plans...\\n\\nAs the sisters attack, flanked by an army of thralls, the Hag Mother will meet them with glee. It is time to eliminate this treacherous Coven, for the power they wield will soon be Ostankya's alone!	false

What lies below? What foul presence dares trespass on these lands? There is only one way to find out…\\n\\nOstankya has sought out the source of this plague, finding a nest of diseased Skaven, basking in their own filth. They must be shown that their incursion is unwelcome. Yet something tells Ostankya the true root of this malevolence has yet to rear its head...	false

Unwilling to have her Dark Magic breach the sanctity of their land, they stand in staunch opposition to her ways, ready to fight to the death to keep her from channelling the Spirit Essence that lies within their woodland. So, it is death that Ostankya shall give them. The evil and malevolent spirits of the forest will heed the witch's call; with their aid, these foolish guardians must be cast aside for ever daring to bar the Hag Mother's path.	false

As protector of the land, Mother Ostankya will suffer the trespass of corruption no longer. Having initiated the Malediction of Ruin, she must hold firm against the oncoming hordes of darkness until the ritual is finally complete. As enemies swarm the capital like flies, all hope of victory relies upon the Malediction of Ruin's earth-shattering power finally being released.	false

It is rare that one would seek them out, yet Mother Ostankya remains unphased by the armies of Undeath. Her plan for these ghastly creatures is clear: slay the foul hordes to set their spirits free. Once their souls roam untethered, they can finally be broken, forced and enthralled into her service as soldiers in an army of ghosts.	false

They have already made their way inland and are dangerously close to the crystals she has come to harvest – or perhaps the cave harbours something else that they desire? Having foreseen her opposition, Mother Ostankya knows she must beat them to the cave in the mountains at all costs to claim the crystal before their meddling ruins her plans.	false

One final step remains to complete his journey, monstrous odds stacked against him that must be overcome. Your Warriors of Tzeentch rally around this unlikely hero, but it will surely be the strength of your host that will sway the tide of victory against the Doombull.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_qb_tze_the_changeling_the_tricksters_staff	Feeding upon the greed of men and Dwarfs, the Changeling has played two groups of merchants effortlessly in orchestration of a bloodbath, simply because he can. This has gone better than he could have imagined – the Dwarfs are not the only ones preparing to take up arms within Karak Azgaraz, but also other heavily-armed merchants of the nations of men. In a whimsical moment of playfulness, the Changeling has let the details of his ruse become known to Dwarf messengers, and they are already on their way to the Hold. If they manage to deliver the news before being put to slaughter, this could be quite the battle!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_badlands_and_southlands	Working insidious sorcery, the Changeling's spellcasting hordes aim to rob the Tomb Kings of their sacred monument, sowing Chaos and carnage in abundance. Weaving their magic upon the Black Pyramid, the whole structure will be lifted into the skies and re-settled in foreign lands. Yet such a trick will be no easy feat. To work their mischief, the Sorcerers must be protected against the oncoming hordes of death, until the Black Pyramid has been ripped clean from the earth.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_bretonnia	The Bretonnian Knights ride forth, hoping to halt the armies of Tzeentch and end the Chaos wracking their homeland. The Changeling, of course, has other plans. Slaying the opposing forces would leave the path wide open to the vast crypts beneath the so-called Land of Chivalry, gifting Mousillon's Necromancers with a near endless army of Undead at their disposal. As it stands, the fabled Green Knight of Bretonnia is all that preserves the defenders' resolve...	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_chaos_wastes	The endless feud between the Ruinous Powers is nothing if not amusing for Tzeentch, for the more they bitterly struggle for power, the more easily the Changeling's schemes go unnoticed. Their latest prank has only exacerbated tensions in the Chaos Wastes; with the forces of Khorne and Slaanesh summoned to the realm of Nurgle, the squabbling has only just begun! As all set their gaze upon the Changeling's army, so too does the Architect of Fate, casting His eye above the battlefield to aid in the torment of His enemies.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_darklands	Rebellion has long been brewing amongst the labour camps of the Dark Lands, where the Black Orcs begin to rally against the tyranny of their greedy mountain masters. The workers are fortunate that the Changeling is nothing if not a champion of freedom, gladly aiding in their uprising out of the unkindness of his heart... And if Chaos swallows the region whole, killing servant and master alike? Well, such is the price of liberty. At the very least, Tzeentch will surely delight in the pandemonium of battle.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_empire	With the planning of an Imperial summit underway, the Changeling pounced on the opportunity to sow the seeds of dissension across the Empire. Having deceived the delegate from Altdorf into arriving late, the forces of Tzeentch have the chance to ambush the other delegates at their meeting place, with the forces from Altdorf nowhere to be seen. Once their leaders flee, they will have no choice but to assume the treachery of their imperial ally. By the time the warriors of Altdorf arrive, the damage to their reputation will have already been done!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_grand_cathay	With a hollow heart and a mind for mischief, the Changeling relishes the chance to see Cathay fall to Ruin, guiding a Skaven Warlock Engineer to the very base of the Grand Bastion. The structure's magical protections will matter little with such a beast burrowing beneath it! Yet, the armies of the Dragon will stop at nothing to halt its progress. The Changeling's success hinges on defending the Skaven beast until its work is done – only then will the Gates of the Grand Bastion crumble, and the whole of Cathay lie exposed.	false

With the Norscan forces lured to battle, the Changeling's devious plan is set in motion. The savage hordes of the north need only be weakened, for once the Raven's spellcasters have worked their magic, Wulfrik and his barbarian tribes will be teleported away to wreak havoc across the land. The Changeling may simply point him at a target and watch the Chaos commence!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_lustria	The Changeling's armies sweep out against the Lizardmen, throwing their soldiers into disarray. As a result, the Plaque of Sotek they were transporting lies almost ripe for the taking! Should the Trickster seize it, the Great Plan could be entirely re-written – by the insidious rats of Clan Pestilens no less – dragging the Cold Ones' entire society into discord. The Lizardmen will not let such a sacred artefact be stolen without a fight, however. If there is any hope of claiming the Plaque, the savage reptilian warriors that guard it must first be put to the slaughter.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_naggaroth	The Dark Elves would let their slaves rot within their towering Black Arks, however the Changeling foresees a different fate for the wretches. With the forces of Naggaroth backed against their floating fortresses, their full attention is sure to be on the warriors of Tzeentch before them. So distracted, they will never expect their own slaves to attack while their backs are turned. Transformed into grotesque Bloated Corpses, they will sink the Dark Elves' once mighty fleet, and swallow the forces of their former masters whole!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_changeling_theatre_scheme_ulthuan	Wielding the twisted sorcery of Tzeentch, the Changeling's forces have charged the Great Vortex of Ulthuan, slowly tainting its magic with the corruption of Slaanesh. Though the High Elves hope to put an end to the scheme, Tzeentch's Trickster will delight in holding them back until the vortex is engulfed in the malevolent energies of Ruin. Should the spellcasters succeed, all of Ulthuan will be swamped in the Prince of Pleasure's corruption. As such, perhaps the Dark Prince will send the Changeling allies, to ensure his meddling succeeds.	false

The Slayer-Engineer’s oath to defend human allies means reinforcements from the Empire will fight alongside him, though he certainly needs little help or encouragement to fight slavers, and even less to punish the Dark Elves for oppressing his kin! Then afterwards, perhaps an opportunity to find out if this savvy, would-be tinkerer is in need of gainful employment.	false

And there he has rested ever since, encased in ice. Until now, for Boris Bokha wakes from his hibernation, having heard the death-roar of Ursun.\\n\\nHowever, the Great Enemy is quick to act. Tzeentch's minions surround the ice, weaving a powerful spell to weaken the Motherland's wards and crack open Boris' frozen casket. The Sorcerers must be toppled from their perches and slain before their spell is complete.	false

It now lies at the centre of the Fractal Maze. The crystalline walls channel magic at the cloak to fray it, and thus reveal the power Tzeentch requires to merge crystal and ice – linking his realm to the Motherland. Katarin must act quickly to reclaim the cloak!	false

The Burning Brazier, wielded by Kostaltyn has only smouldered of late, but the hatred of these interlopers shall kindle the flame to brightness once more!\\n\\nRushing headlong into Dark Elf bolts will not serve Ursun, defend and then unleash righteous fury when the time is right. Be wary, for the Black Arks of the Druchii carry many crew, scouting parties have come ashore at several points but now prey has been spotted they will converge on the Kislevites from several directions.	false

It has also proven difficult to collect enough bearded specimens to experiment on, for they are wont to fight back and inconsiderate enough to prefer dying in battle and rage rather than meekly waiting to be collected.\\n\\nNow, there is an opportunity – deep under the ground in what the mortals call "the Underway", Ku'gath shall suppress their iron will with a vile effluvium that will not be dissipated in the open air. But even before it is released, the Dwarfs' spirit must be defeated and crushed in battle. They will fight hard, for they don't like trespassers in their caves. Expect them to send for reinforcements.	false

He needs to be crushed, his skull stamped hard into the ash on the mountainside of the Fire Mouth. Then the crown will shine up real good.\\n\\nBut this Orc is cunning, one of the reasons he has grown to become such a threat. He surrounds himself with Goblins so he may cast them into battle caring not of their fate while keeping his boys back to do the real damage...	false

There, as he wallowed in the depths, despairing of his defeat, he lost the Daemonic blade given to him by the Dark Prince. Now the search has narrowed, the Witstealer Sword is close, but the High Elves – alerted by their arcane wards – have already sent a host to guard its location and prevent their hated enemy from being reunited with his beloved blade.\\n\\nN'Kari must not waste time tormenting his foes, but break through the choke points and slay any that stand in his way, so he alone can claim the sword.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_pro_mom_qb_04_altar_of_ultimate_darkness	Foolish mortals so easily confuse ultimate darkness for ultimate power when it dangles like a poisonous, unpicked apple enticing their desires. Those who covet such things may think it the means to Chaos’ demise, but often it is to the contrary. Battle is as much nourishment for Tzeentch as it is for the other gods – endure the Everchosen’s aggressions and receive the Altar’s boons.	false

The obstacles and traps created by His mortal mind await the doomed souls who seek passage into the Impossible Fortress, but things will be simpler for you. The Fateweaver, mighty Lord of Change, hindsight and foresight manifest, provides your challenge and carries your prize. Tzeentch’s slaughter-fields beckon.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh3_prologue_brazen_altar	The Brazen Altar lies in the heart of the Chaos Wastes. Some claim it was built by Khorne's followers in defiance of those that created the Howling Citadel. Ever since, it has been a sacred site of the Blood God. Now Yuri Barkov, prince of the Ungols, must approach, for inscribed upon it are the runes to summon the Bridge-Maker. But the Brazen Altar is guarded – even now Khorne sends one of his favoured pets to ensure it will not be defiled.	false

Within – he is told – is a portal that will take him to the lost Bear-God. But entrance to the Citadel will not go uncontested. The traitor, Boyar Kurnz, guards its entrance with his army of Chaos followers and darker allies. However, Yuri has a boon of his own – for a great price he has made a pact with the Bridge-Maker, an exalted Greater Daemon of Khorne, and a creature that cares not from where the blood flows!	false

The Prince of Kislev must enter the Lucent Maze, a devious labyrinth dedicated to Tzeentch. Yuri's force of brave Kislevites must traverse the outskirts of the maze and repulse the Daemons of Tzeentch. Only then can he alone – the paragon of the Bear-God – enter its twisted passages.	false

Archaon cares not, his eyes are only on the prize worn by the challenger. Should he win he gains another relic of the Everchosen, the Armour of Morkar himself. But first he must be victorious, and such trials will be anything but easy, for the Dark Gods take great delight in playing with their champions - especially those fated for greatness. 	false

He knows of these creatures that, while they are impressive on the battlefield compared to mundane warriors, it is their arcane might he must vanquish. But when Tzeentch's Greater Daemon is banished back to the Realm of Chaos, leaving the Crown of Domination in its wake, then the End Times will truly begin.	false

The Chaos Lord will not give up his prize so easily, his army will be constantly reinforced, much to his stepfather's delight. This must be a test or trial of sorts! 	false

They come searching for Khazrak; they will find him, but it will be on the Banebeast’s terms, for Khazrak will catch Todbringer and his foolish wolves in an ambush! The Beastlord must be ready to strike at the right moment. One-Eye knows that to launch an attack too early, or even too late, could be the warherd's undoing.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc03_qb_bst_the_final_battle	A grand alliance of the Empire and Bretonnia has mustered. It is a desperate act, the dying throes of a race close to extinction, yet a cornered beast is at times the most dangerous. Bretonnian cavalry are working in concert with the Empire's artillery and ranked infantry. Caution is advised, for we must strike at the right moment or be undone by this most-disciplined of hosts!	false

Now is the time to strike and rescue the Jade Griffon from their evil designs. The Vampires will not shun battle, yet Hel Fenn has a cursed history, and one that does not favour the von Carsteins. However, there are plenty of bodies about to summon forth and bolster their shambling hordes, so whilst the Grand Theogonist should strike quickly, the Sigmarites must also be wary of reinforcements.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc04_qb_emp_volkmar_the_grim_staff_of_command_stage_4_altdorf_outskirt	The Emperor is not best pleased that this battle is happening, but for Volkmar's sake he is loath to forbid it. If the enemy general, the Ar-Ulric's loyal servant, be slain then an uneasy peace should quickly follow between the two sides. By the same token, it is clear that the Ar-Ulric wishes the Grand Theogonist dead, thinking his replacement would be more amenable to Ulrican concerns... perhaps. For Volkmar to reclaim his staff it is clear he will need to slay the enemy Lord in Sigmar's name as quickly as possible!	false

Once the Cult of Sigmar has the casket that holds the pages, then Ghorst will strike - an ambush to take the Empire men by surprise and rid them of both their lives and the cursed pages! Ghorst's plan is a sound one, but his Vampiress ally counsels caution - the Cult of Sigmar's resources are vast and should the Arch Lector come under attack then reinforcements are likely!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc04_qb_vmp_vlad_von_carstein_blood_drinker_stage_4_devastation_of_ostermark	At last an army worthy of restoring Blood Drinker!

Vlad should use this learning against them if he is to seek victory.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc04_qb_vmp_vlad_von_carstein_the_von_carstein_ring_stage_4_ruins_of_ostermark	Vlad's hopes of a speedy raid against the mine are thwarted. The site is claimed by a king of the Strigoi and his ghoul swarms - the pathetic legacy of a doomed people that worshipped Nagash as a god. The creature is unimpressed by the Count, refusing to kowtow to Vlad or give him leave to take the Warpstone. Vlad's anger rises, and so the Undead will meet each other in battle!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_bst_morghur_stave_of_ruinous_corruption	These pathetic forest-dwelling Elves come for Morghur, but he must hold fast. The ritual is well underway - he cannot let Ariel and her minions take from him that which he has toiled over for so long. Morghur is beset, but the position is defensible; the waves of Elves will come and crash upon the Beastmen as waves crash upon the rocks. They shall leave nothing for Ariel to identify them by. A Ruinous power flows through Morghur, so that he might smite the Elven pretenders with Chaotic fury!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_durthu_daiths_sword_stage_4_battle_of_cairns	The foul stench of Necromancy infects every inch of this accursed field. If the glades are to be restored to their former sanctity, this scourge must be expunged. Yet the Eldest of Ancients must take care; more Undead will filter onto the field as the Necromancer takes hold of more cadavers. Durthu must strike fast and cut the head from this serpent. The Necromancer himself must fall, for it is he who controls these shuffling thralls. Once he is gone, they will soon lose their sense of purpose. One fell strike with all the strength of the Ancients behind him and Durthu will see this blight excised and the forests restored!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_grand_defense_of_the_oak	A great horde of Beastmen besiege the Oak of Ages! There are brayherds present from every corner of the Old World; Morghur has summoned to him the Dark Omen, Malagor, and even Khazrak the One-Eye is said to be stalking the field. The Beastmen are drawn here to enact a final, bitter blow against the roots of life itself. Should they succeed, all will be plunged into a hell beyond reckoning and without end. They must be stopped before they bring this land to Ruin. Defend the Oak; defend the Old World!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_grand_silver_spire	So it has come to this. Morghur has thrown an almost endless torrent of Beastmen at the Wood Elves, yet they have pushed back the tide. Now the Shadowgave makes one final gambit - a push for the Silver Spire itself, intent on poisoning the water supply that nurtures so much of the land and leaving it for dead. He cannot be allowed to succeed. Yet Morghur has dark and twisted schemes that make him extremely difficult to kill - the Asrai must watch carefully and use their superior Elven intelligence to overwhelm his trickery. Hold fast against these desperate beasts, see the day won and the Old World saved!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_orion_the_cloak_of_isha_stage_3_the_night_glens	This Glade Lord is beyond salvation! She has given herself wholly to the dark lord Slaanesh; she is nothing more than a puppet of Chaos now, she must be purged! Her retinue lies across from Orion, but there will doubtless be more coming to her aid. This aid will not take the form of Elves, however, as the Ruinous Powers seek to secure their fleeting foothold on this realm. Dark and corrupted forces will try to stop Orion in his endeavour, but he must hold firm against them all and recover the relic before it is snatched away beyond his reach.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_orion_the_horn_of_the_wild_stage_3_witherhold	The herd, and Morghur with it, had no idea that Orion and his warriors had located and infiltrated their secret beast-paths. And so the Elves descend upon them with pride and vengeance in their hearts. However, they are deep within enemy territory now and do not know from which direction further Beastmen may come to aid their brothers and forestall Elven vengeance. And so Orion must be swift, he must be strong and above all he must be furious; let the rage of the ancient forest of Athel Loren rain destruction upon these calamitous fiends, that they never darken the forest again.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc05_qb_wef_orion_the_spear_of_kurnous_stage_3_the_oak_of_ages	These violent desires must not come to fruition. Orion is all that stands between the Oak of Ages and the utter ruin of Athel Loren. They will come from the south, intent on breaking through Orion's defences and attacking the Oak, but the king will stand firm. Indeed he must, for the alternative is the destruction of the forest as he knows it. Yet Anath Raema is determined, she will see the rebel band is reinforced with her minions where possible. Orion and his forces must be ever-vigilant, although with all of Athel Loren behind him and the power of Ariel within his soul he cannot fail. He will not fail! He will see these dark desires meet a violent end and peace return to Athel Loren's gentle glades.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc06_qb_dwf_belegar_hammer_of_angrund_stage_4_karak_eight_peaks	A mighty battle awaits, for the prize is great! The urks will not make this easy, for they have gathered in great numbers and, as news of the Dwarfs coming spreads across the rest of the Peaks, more Greenskins will no doubt come to join the fray. This is Ironhammer's moment - should he be victorious, then he could well be the first of the Angrund line to wield King Lunn’s hammer in generations!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc06_qb_dwf_belegar_ironhammer_shield_of_defiance_stage_3_subterranean	The Greenskins sought to use the ancient halls of Belegar's Ancestors as a means to wreak havoc in the Karaz Ankor, but instead it is they who are undone - caught within the realms of the Dwarfs and trapped. Allies from Karak Azul will take the urks from behind. It is our job to face the urks head on and crush them!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc06_qb_grn_skarsnik_skarsniks_prodder_stage_5_karak_eight_peaks	Here come the stunties again, but there's more of them and they seem even angrier than before. Good! Such dark emotions will further empower Skarsnik's new prodder, making the artefact even more spiteful. First, though, he must be victorious. The flanking worked last time, but will the stubborn Dwarfs fall for the same 'tricksy trap' a second time?	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc06_qb_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_baleful_mask_stage_4_barrier_idols	At last! The false prophet has stopped hiding like a coward and is forced to face Wurrzag. The Goblin has taken position on a hill, where he’ll be difficult to shift. But just before Wurrzag commits to battle, he falls into a trance – Gork is talking to him. The Great Green God warns his Shaman that the sneaky gobbo is laying a trap and more of his mates are skulking close by. Gits!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc06_qb_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_bonewood_staff_stage_4_black_fire_pass	Black Fire Pass is a place of legend. Not only is it the scene of many a battle, its mountainsides are riddled with ancient Dwarf Halls and lost dungeons. These catacombs are prime quest territory for parties of adventurers searching for riches and lost heirlooms. One such party has emerged into the gloomy daylight to see Wurrzag’s army gathering in the pass. To take Wurrzag’s head as a prize, to deliver it before the Imperial throne, would be a great bounty. And so the heroes decide to attack, but they are not foolish enough to believe they can fight this hoard alone, they fight with a rapidly-approaching Empire army at their backs!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc06_qb_grn_wurrzag_da_great_green_prophet_squiggly_beast_stage_3	Gashtooth’s army gathers to face Wurrzag’s boyz. Suspiciously, there doesn’t seem to be anyone about... yet. Wurrzag’s scout re-joins the force, looking worse for wear. He tried to use his ‘in-ish-a-tive’ to capture one of these soopa-Squigs but the beast got so angry it exploded! Looks like these mushrooms may harbour some lethal side-effects!\\n\\nAs the Greenskin hordes prepare to charge each other Gashtooth produces the Squiggly Beast. In a taunting gesture he shows Wurrzag’s pet a glowing mushroom. The beast - always hungry - tries to grab the mushroom but it is kept tantalisingly out of reach. If Wurrzag wants his pet back - and unchanged - he needs to attack now! Waaagh!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_alberic_trident_of_manann_stage_8_estalian_tomb	This rogue Knight and his army sit in a most defensible position on the far side of the battlefield from the Duke's own force. Between them is an open field offering little cover. Beyond that Alberic must face the steeled, readied mercenary Knights. He must also beware of the guns used by these brigands – they would rather shoot from afar than fight with honour and courage. However, if Alberic holds true, then no force can forestall his judgement!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_errantry_war_northern_chaos_wastes_stage_1_cliff_of_beasts	Our march through the Chaos Wastes have been tough, Sire, but at last our courage seems to have been rewarded. Along the Cliff of Beasts, our scouts return with news that the forces of Ruin have decided to meet us in battle. Led by Archaon the Everchosen, and accompanied by the Prince of Slaneesh, Sigvald the Magnificent, the Chaos army seem ready to offer us a fight for the ages! The skies above, ever ominous during our perilous journey, turn now even more despondent. Thunder rolls across the grizzly clouds, and in the distance, lightning arcs through the deepening sky. The air hisses with static; could this be the moment of our destiny?	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_errantry_war_southern_badlands_stage_1_the_lost_idol	My Lord! The outriders have returned from their reconnaissance with reports of a Greenskin force massing ahead of us. They are encamped on a defensible ridge, and have brought their bizarre artillery to further fortify the position – they appear ready to fight to the last. Further reports seem to indicate that they are bolstered by a great gathering of Warbosses, who seem bent on bringing their full strength to bear against you. It is clear they want the same thing we do – a decisive battle to decide our fates once and for all. We must not relent – their scourge must be wiped from the world!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_fay_enchantress_stage_6_chalice_of_potions	Although the Fay Enchantress did much and more with her potion, summoning a spell of unmatched power, the fiends of Chaos still managed to land on Bretonnian shores, though in numbers much diminished. Their force still poses great danger, however, if it is not defeated here.\\n\\nThe effects of the potion yet linger upon the beleaguered enemy, however, which gives the Bretonnians an edge. The Fay Enchantress has spent much of her strength on the storm that destroyed the fleet, yet the Winds of Magic still blow strong; she should be able to continue to attack them through magical means. Though they are numerous, the Chaos hordes are fatigued and susceptible to attack; take advantage of this and show them no quarter - the ocean is only retreat for them!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc07_qb_brt_louen_leoncouer_sword_of_couronne_stage_4_la_maisontaal_abbey	The source of this vile mist is made apparent, yet here at its source it is thicker and more obfuscating than ever. At the heart of the fog lies a great army of Greenskins who can be heard beyond the obscuring effluvium with much yelling, grunting, clattering, zogging and twatting. Bretonnian Knights have thus far managed to hold back all incursions into their precious realm, yet the stakes are even higher now; the fate of Bretonnia itself hangs in the balance, for Zugrak Gobspit and his deadly Skullsmasherz have arrived. They are far more deadly than the average standard chaotic Greenskin host, so caution is advised lest the enemy surround and destroy the Bretonnian forces, their advances hidden beneath the all-consuming murk.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_chs_final_battle_khorne	The Hound God sits brooding upon a vast and ornately carved brass throne atop a great mountain of blood-stained bones, observing the progress of other champions with disdain. Although impressed by slaughter, it is insulted when the killing is not done in its name, so sends its own challenger…	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_chs_final_battle_nurgle	The ancient Crow God is very established amongst the Norscan tribes, personified as a gigantic and massively bloated creature surrounded by dark clouds of tiny daemonic insects. It is thought to be a ‘generous’ spirit, always interested in the plight of its mortal followers. Now, however, that generosity has worn thin for those who have rejected it, and so its repulsive challenger is sent to deliver punishment.	false

The allure of the Serpent is highly addictive, and so it becomes infuriated at those who resist the lure of its pride, arrogance, and excess. Now it sends a challenger, as charismatic as all the Serpent’s champions…	false

Yet now the puppet master has one more plan – to send its challenger against those who shun it…	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_0	A dangerous, murderous Chaos Frost Dragon is a great offering to the Gods indeed, and none are more dangerous and murderous than Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void. It appears only where the worst snow storms fall, so to hunt it down you must battle the worst of the elements as well as the monster itself.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_1	Perhaps the scariest of all giant humanoid monster species, Cygors are some of the angriest creatures to roam the Old World. The Salzenmund Soul-Eaters are a pair of Cygors even bigger and stronger than others of their kind, making them among the most difficult monsters to hunt. Their cycloptic eyes not only see the Winds of Magic, but also dampen their use for most spellcasters in their presence.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_2	As creatures of Chaos, Dragon Ogre Shaggoths are a highly-favourable sacrifice to the Dark Gods, but also extremely difficult to bring down. Their strength and power are proportional to their age, making the millennia-old Traygard Mountain-Cleaver in particular a truly-challenging target for the hunt. Beware the lightning!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_3	Arachnarok Queens are the type of despicable poisonous monster that should not be trifled with. One Venom Queen is hard enough to bring down, but to take on this bounty you will have to face multiple Queens – the Brood Queens of Karak Azul. All in a day’s hunt!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_4	Blorgar the Mad Titan is a brutish and highly flatulent Giant wreaking havoc in the Grey Mountains. As his name suggests, he has no real agenda except to mindlessly trample settlements and squish their inhabitants under his colossal wart-ridden feet. The Dark Gods may favour such an unpredictable and destructive being, but they shall surely favour you more for slaying it in their name!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_5	Somewhere amongst the lush glades of Athel Loren lives Radixashen, Serpent of the Worldroots. Although the Wood Elves are highly adept at protecting their territory, when the forest is in real peril this mighty Forest Dragon will come to their aid. It is a terrific bounty, but in sacrificing it you will be depriving the forest of one of its champions - it will not be given up easily!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_6	A great prize awaits the hunter who dares brave the most desolate reaches of the northern tundra.

Slaying them will surely bring great favour!	false

Little is known about the Abyssal Shrieker, except that many a hunter has fallen trying to fell it!	false

Heading southward into civilised lands to search for it, Throgg eventually finds himself pursuing a treasure-hoarding Runelord who he believes has it in his possession. As he catches up to the Runelord’s convoy, Throgg sees that the Dwarf force have not been caught off-guard and are expecting him, so an ambush is not possible. They have already taken up a defensive position at a small chokepoint in the road. Best be quick – this is the Dwarf heartland after all.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_wulfrik_sword_of_torgald	The Dark Gods have sent Wulfrik the Wanderer visions, compelling him to travel deep into the Bretonnian heartland to duel a famous hero who is as yet unknown to him. To draw out his mysterious adversary, Wulfrik must attack the site of a keep said to contain important holy relics and stately heirlooms of the Bretonnian kingdom. The first thing to do is to slaughter the pathetic rabble they have sent to defend it, then maybe this so-called champion will make an appearance!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_armour_of_skaldour_stage_4_troll_country	The Dwarfs plant their oath stones at a crossroads - a defiant gesture to the creatures of Troll Country. The throng will not be moved until the cull has happened. The Dawi will stand firm as wave after wave of monsters are drawn to what they think is prey. It will be a long haul, but the purge must happen! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_axe_of_grimnir_stage_3_the_pillar_of_bone	Speed will win the day here, not always a Dwarfen characteristic, but perhaps recent innovations will plug that gap? In any case, those filthy grobi magic-users are making some ritual, they must be disrupted, and quickly, or no doubt tougher reinforcements will follow. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_book_of_grudges_stage_3_battle_of_hel_fenn	This is a fell place. It reeks of dead umgi. Of the enemy, there is no sign yet... But Thorgrim must attend to claim vengeance on innocent Dawi that did nothing but travelled through the area to make a just profit. The High King has sworn that the Dammaz Kron will stay shut until vengeance is claimed. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_dragon_crown_of_karaz_stage_3_black_fire_pass	Thorgrim must defend the pass, as his ancestors have done many times before. Let us hope that the umgi will heed the summons and send forth their own warriors. In the meantime the High King's throng must fight and hold back the green tide. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_intro_subterranean	The king must make his way through the Underway, an area under the dominion of urks and grobi. Be wary of the side passages, for it stinks of an ambush, even if the Everpeak Aircorps is en route to offer support. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_axe_of_dargo_stage_4_battle_of_high_pass	Ungrim will meet the Chaos scum in the high peaks of his mountain realm. This will be battle hard won, for the Northmen come as if sent by the Chaos Gods themselves to end the discordant song within the Axe of Dargo. A bitter fight then, and one the Slayer King must win! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_dragon_cloak_of_fyrskar_stage_4_battle_of_broken_leg_gully	No more guile, now is the time to match blades in open battle. This horde is heavy with Orcs, but there are Trolls within the ranks too. Good! For what is the use of a Troll-slayer if there are no Trolls to slay!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_slayer_crown_stage_5_6_ancient_dragon_cave	The Undead adopt a defensive stance around their Lord. Pale skeletal warriors await the Dwarfs in a silence broken only by mindless moans of numberless Zombies and the feral cackling of Ghouls and other nameless horrors. Ungrim must strike, and strike now - for who knows what is being called to Undeath from within the cave. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_balthasar_gelt_amulet_of_sea_gold_stage_4.1_estalian_tomb	The men are correct to fear, something old stirs, and it does not welcome the invaders. Even so, Gelt has fought the Undead before, and this will surely be a small presence. He looks to the men, demands valour and then begins to channel the Winds of Magic. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_balthasar_gelt_cloak_of_molten_metal_stage_5_ancient_dragon_cave	This dark lair is home to a mage of some sort. Gelt can feel it's energy and the presence of Dark Magic. There are Undead here, of that there is no question, but what great monster has been summoned from its deathbed deep in the cave, Gelt is convinced he's about to find out... 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_balthasar_gelt_staff_of_volans_stage_3_battle_of_bloodpine_woods	Gelt must prepare for an arcane duel. Orr has always been a powerful rival, and highly-capable mage. He is sure to attack early, so Gelt must prepare his magical defences. He must also be especially wary, as the ambush will not be the only part of Orr's plan - he will have something else up his white robe...	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_karl_franz_ghal_maraz_stage_4_black_fire_pass	Karl Franz has so far shunned the use of Ghal Maraz - symbol of the Emperor - for fear of further angering those hostile to his coronation. But should he be victorious this day, then the warhammer can be claimed with clear conscience! But first he must face a massive army of Orcs and Goblins in Black Fire Pass, just as Sigmar did before him; and as with Sigmar over two thousand years ago, he hopes that the Dwarfs will be there as allies!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_karl_franz_intro_battle_of_bloodpine_woods	So it is, the Empire must fight against its own kind for survival within the bounds of the Empire itself. We must be wary for there are more than traitors lurking in Bloodpine Woods. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_karl_franz_reikland_runefang_stage_3_the_threat_from_the_north	The coast of Nordland has been ravaged by Norse raiders, but no longer! Franz knows this is a test of his sovereignty, that the unconvinced Electors will be watching and even hoping he fails. So he must face the Norsemen and be victorious. They will come in waves, like the very sea itself!  	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_emp_karl_franz_silver_seal_stage_3.1_shrine_of_ill_omen	The thief stands upon the brow of a hill, surrounded by a horde of Undead. We must be wary, for she is a formidable enemy and will no doubt use her accursed Dark Magic to bring forth more corpses to aid her plight. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_grn_azhag_the_slaughterer_azhags_ard_armour_stage_4_burial_mound_of_grudsnik_da_magnificent	That hill, Grudsnik's Mound, is the key. And the humies are camped on it. But these humies like their nags, no doubt they're behind the hill ready to flank Azhag's force. But Azhag wasn't born yesterday - he don't know when 'ee woz born! - he'll need to make sure the humies and nags don't catch him off guard - smash the hill-based gits before the pincer closes! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_grn_azhag_the_slaughterer_crown_of_sorcery_stage_3_todtheim	This city is evil, even for an Orc of Azhag's temperament. Yet the loot in the city is worth the risk, even if that risk is facing against Chaos and the Undead. The Chaos forces will be attacking from within the ruins, Gork knows where the Undead will be striking from! Watch the skies, for they will be full of "vile fings". 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_grn_azhag_the_slaughterer_slaggas_slashas_stage_4_barrier_idols	These Orcs may be savages but they have yet to face the Slaughterer. Those on the hill are a formidable force, but will not be the only enemies in the forthcoming battle. Azhag must be wary of the flanks, for this is where the savages will surely strike once the hill attack begins. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_grn_grimgor_ironhide_blood_forged_armour_stage_4_battle_of_high_pass	While others quail at the thought of fighting Chaos, for Grimgor this is more than a mere challenge - it is an absolute joy! Be wary though, if the Northmen worship the Blood God then it'll be a straight-up scrap, but if they are dedicated to one of the sneakier powers, then there may be a few surprises or even traps to confront. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_grn_grimgor_ironhide_gitsnik_stage_4_black_fire_pass	Beyond Black Fire Pass stands the lush humie realms, ripe for stomping. But first Grimgor must break through this army. The humies will be hard to shift, and there are rumours that they'll be getting stunty reinforcements. All things to consider, since Grimgor's force is all here with nothing left in reserve. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_grn_grimgor_ironhide_intro_subterranean	Dwarfs travelling along this lost dark road are ripe for an ambush. Don't let the beardy gits form a defensive perimeter. Get 'em in the flanks nice an' early and den smack 'em from behind with da big stuff! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_chaos_tomb_blade_stage_4_glacial_lake	As Kemmler's host step onto the frozen lake, the Lichemaster spots more minions of the Ruinous Powers hacking their way into the ice seeking out Krell's tomb. In response to his approach, the Marauders abandon their excavation and ready their weapons. It is a small force, and will quickly be overwhelmed. This is almost too easy! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_cloak_of_mists_stage_3_marbads_tomb	Kemmler decides the best way to rid Marbad's Tomb of the Goblin infestation is to lay a trap. His minions lie in wait - an ambush for the Goblinoids! When the Greenskins approach, via the channel between the hillsides, the Lichemaster will strike! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_skull_staff_stage_3_la_maisontaal_abbey	Kemmler will use the Empire puppets to confront the Bretonnians. Let the foolish Knights smash their lances against the corpses of the broken Empire. When he strikes with the full might of the Undead, the abbey's secrets will be his!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_armour_of_templehof_stage_6_burial_mound_of_grudsnik_da_magnificent	The Undead legion marches west under the fearsome banner of von Carstein. Mannfred is determined to claim the Armour of Templehof from Grudsnik's tomb and will slay any mortal fool who gets in his way! Let the mortals think they can outwit the Count with flanking attacks. Mannfred is ancient, and has seen such archaic tactics many times before. 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_intro_battle_of_hel_fenn	Hel Fenn, a place Mannfred is not fond of for historical reasons. But these mortals pose no such threat! They are few in number and while they have a strong position between two rocks, they can be flanked easily enough. It will not take long for these fools to join our Unliving ranks! 	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_main_qb_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_sword_of_unholy_power_stage_4_the_pillar_of_bone	The slaughter of so many Greenskins close to an Arcane Fulcrum should provide the right conditions for the Count to bind the Necromantic energy into an artefact. He must destroy this Goblin Shaman and his underlings defending the pillar and do it before any Greenskin reinforcements arrive!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_pro01_qb_dwf_grombrindal_armour_of_glimril_stage_3_marbads_tomb	This is a battle of bitter foes - there is more than mere honour at stake. The White Dwarf has encountered this Chaos Dragon before, when the fell creature struck the Ancestor Lord, shattering Glimril scales from Grombrindal's armour. Such a slight cannot remain unaccounted for - defeating the Chaos Lord will allow the White Dwarf to recover the scales and complete his armour once more. Such a thing is no easy task - Marbad's Tomb has seen much blood spilt and this battle will be no different. These Beastmen thralls are no ordinary Gors, and Tzeentch has supplied his servant with more than one surprise...	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_pro01_qb_dwf_grombrindal_rune_axe_of_grimnir_stage_3_golden_monolith	The White Dwarf faces a massive Chaos army, the like of which has not been seen in many years. Grombrindal and his throng steel themselves for the task ahead; he is glad its ranks are so numerous as he must slay many to fulfil his oath!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_pro01_qb_dwf_grombrindal_rune_cloak_of_valaya_stage_3_todtheim	The Undead army is revealed and the White Dwarf is keen to halt this trespass into Valaya's realm. It is no surprise to Grombrindal that these dead urks are led by a Vampire. That must be dealt with quickly, but the rune that now glows brightly on the White Dwarf's cloak foretells that several waves of Undead are to be expected.	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_pro01_qb_dwf_grombrindal_rune_helm_of_zhufbar_stage_4_thundering_falls	The forces of Karak Azul are already in the midst of fighting when Grombrindal's throng deploys. It was a dangerous task, but one the proud Dwarfs of that Hold willingly volunteered for. However, now the White Dwarf must come to their aid or risk dishonour!\\n\\nAs Gotrek previously warned, this Greenskin horde is full of monsters -a fetish of the Warboss, but one that the Dawi will easily overcome. Thundering Falls makes for a perfect trap through which to take on such creatures, which is why it was chosen, but hopefully the Warboss was not canny enough to keep back any monstrous reserves!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_wh_pro02_qb_vmp_isabella_von_carstein_blood_chalice_of_bathori_stage_5_marbads_tomb	These ignorant Empire guards are ill-prepared to face Isabella's fury - there is no rage like that of the Vampire Countess, and she has much to dispense. Beyond them lies the tomb of Marbad the First Elector - who knows what has happened to him since his interment? The weak, pathetic Sigmarite soldiers may not even know what it is they defend!	false
