frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_skv_tretch_craventail	The Skaven are the ratmen gnawing at the roots of the world – an evil and conniving race that outnumber all their enemies. If only they could stop squabbling and backstabbing for long enough, and join together in one mighty alliance, then all their enemies would be wiped out under a furry tide of screeching vermin.\\n\\nBut that is not how the Skaven think. Betrayal, duplicity, and cowardice are the true marks of the Skaven, and in many parts of the Under-Empire such traits are lauded as virtues. Clan Rictus vaunts these qualities – they are extremely rich, with treasure holds said to rival even those of Clan Mors. Rictus dominates the passages and tunnels under Crookback Mountain, a nest-lair deep in the Dark Lands to the east of the World's Edge. However, of late their focus has been pulled far to the west…\\n\\nTretch Craventail has no right to the title of Grand Chieftain of the Deep Warrens, and yet, none answer to it but he. The wretch has risen quickly through the ranks of Clan Rictus on a mixture of luck and outright, unashamed treachery. However, no Skaven can survive on luck alone, and so Tretch is also one of the most conniving and cruel ratmen to have lived in recent times. He has developed – or it was within him all along? – an absolute knack for knowing when lethal trouble is close. It’s at these times that Craventail will mysteriously disappear, leaving whichever retinue he was 'leading' to their inevitable fate.\\n\\nBut despite such a 'boon' – whether a natural talent or a gift from the Horned One himself – Tretch has finally come to the attention of Clan Rictus’ leader, Lord Kratch Doomclaw, a sitting member of the Council of Thirteen. Doomclaw has ordered Tretch lead a Clan Rictus expedition to the Elf-thing lands of Naggaroth, far to the west of Crookback Mountain. It is unclear exactly what Lord Kratch’s motives are but they're probably not altruistic in nature – maybe a play for power using his most capable Chieftains, or a way to rid himself of an annoying and potential rival? Most probably, it is both...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_arkhan	In the Land of the Dead, no name is more hated than Nagash the Arch-Necromancer, architect of Nehekhara’s downfall. It was he that cast a great ritual and brought all the dead back to Unlife ahead of the promised Day of Awakening. Centuries before this epochal moment, he had ruled Khemri, stealing the kingship from his younger brother.\\n\\nArkhan was the most loyal of Nagash’s followers, pivotal in the coup that brought the nascent Necromancer to power. After his lord, Arkhan was the first to imbibe the Elixir of Life, thereby transitioning from mere mortal to Unliving immortal. For decades, Arkhan remained staunchly loyal to Nagash; a great warrior and general, he was also an accomplished student of dark sorcery thanks to his master's teachings. After fifty years of rule, the other cities of Nehekhara revolted against Nagash – desperate to end his malicious reign. The Army of the Seven Kings besieged Khemri, and Nagash was forced to retreat. Arkhan held back the allied Priest Kings’ legions through feats both martial and arcane. He finally fell, not to some hero’s blade but an ordinary spear thrown by a nameless soldier. By his dying breath he cursed both the spear and any that desecrated his corpse.\\n\\nNagash has returned to enact vengeance on Nehekhara several times over the centuries. One of the Arch-Necromancer's first acts was to resurrect his faithful lieutenant. And so Arkhan the Black, the Liche King, rose from the dead, as loyal as always and a key figure in Nagash’s many machinations. In an age of comets and new empires, Nagash remains adrift from the world… for the moment. But he is very much active. Arkhan's Black Tower a beacon for those who worship the Arch-Necromancer as a god-in-waiting. Naturally, his greatest rival – everyone's greatest rival no less – is Settra the Imperishable. The two have fought dozens of times; although Arkhan’s forces cannot rival Settra’s legions, neither can the Imperishable overcome the Liche King’s dark sorcery. Thus, their wars end in stalemate, and only when Arkhan utters false promises of fealty does Settra return satisfied to Khemri. Such false servitude cannot – will not – last, for while there is still a chance to resurrect Nagash, his loyal servant will take it.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_khalida	Beyond the Badlands lies the Land of the Dead. This desert realm is the cradle of mankind’s earliest empire – a civilisation known as Nehekhara that did not just huddle the banks of the Great Vitae River, but straddled the mountains to reach the shores of the Bitter Sea.\\n\\nTo the east, it was dominated by the cities of Lahmia, Mahrak and Lybaras – ruled by great matriarchs. Even so, Khemri remained its greatest prize. When Nagash, the Arch-Necromancer, was defeated by the Army of the Seven Kings, High Queen Neferata of Lahmia acted quickly, even as the alliance dissipated. In secret, she stole the forbidden lore of Nagash to recreate the Elixir of Life. But Neferata’s own concoction was flawed – it did indeed extend her life, but the cost was an unyielding thirst for blood. Neferata had unwittingly created a race that would blight all the world forever more, she became the first Vampire.\\n\\nBy the time her cousin, Khalida of Lybaras, visited for a great feast, most of the Lahmian Court were infected with Vampirism. To display her new found power, Neferata challenged her cousin to ritual combat in front of all in attendance. The two women fought before the shocked nobility, their blades weaving a deadly and delicate dance. But Neferata was no longer a mere mortal, and so bested her cousin. As Khalida lay dying, Neferata let her own cursed blood infect the Lybaran queen, as a final, spiteful act. The Warrior-Queen cried to the gods in desperation, and one answered! The Asp-Goddess heard Khalida's pleas and purged the taint from her veins, at the cost of her life. Khalida’s body was borne back to Lybaras in sorrow, where she was embalmed and placed upon her throne, ready to defend her city and godly patron from behind the wall of death.\\n\\nWhen the Tomb Kings finally awoke from their breathless sleep, Khalida remained on her throne, uninterested in the power-grabbing and politicking of these Undying tyrants. However, when Lybaras is threatened, Khalida acts, and quickly. At Asaph's bidding, she silently rises from her throne and commands her loyal legions to march forth. Khalida fights not merely out of loyalty to the goddess who aided her, she harbours a deep, eternal loathing – not just for her cousin, but all Vampires who dare cross her path.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_khatep	Even when they lived, the Tomb Kings of Nehekhara – or Priest Kings as they were – were obsessed with death. It infuriated them that the gods had seen fit to only grant them just a few short decades upon the world to make their mark and none rankled under that knowledge more than the Great King Settra.\\n\\nDespite having conquered all Nehekhara and ensuring that much of Khemri was made in his image, Settra was obsessed with not just creating a legacy, but outliving it. And so he ordered the Mortuary Cult formed – its purpose to discover the ultimate secret: to cheat death. The Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult was led by Khatep, an extremely gifted and wise seer. It was Khatep who tended to Settra’s dying mortal form and promised the Great King that he would rise again on the Day of Awakening. As the years past, the hieratic cult’s quest for lore was partially successful. The priests themselves learnt how to sustain a form of Unlife, their spirits tethered to their desiccated bodies, yet the knowledge to bring back the kings as eternal demi-gods still lay beyond their grasp. However, they were undeterred and their search continued, all while serving their living kings as advisors and viziers. Thus, the Mortuary Cult spread across Nehekhara.\\n\\nThe arrival of the Arch-Necromancer changed everything. Following the casting of Nagash’s Great Ritual, civil war threatened Nehekhara and Khatep took it upon himself to restore order. He broke open the seals to Settra’s Grand Pyramid, which caused the Great King to rise, filled with an unquenchable wrath. However, Settra had not risen as a beatific sovereign but as a ravaged mummy – this was not the Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult! Settra raged and banished Khatep from Khemri.\\n\\nTo this day Khatep the Liche Lord remains the nominal head of the Mortuary Cult; since his exile he wanders the world, at first restricted to roaming Nehekhara's vast deserts, but of late he has travelled further afield, gathering followers and fellow exiles to seek out the lost lore he hopes will return the Lands of Nehek to glory and rehabilitate his reputation as their saviour!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_political_party_tmb_settra	In the land of Nehekhara, Khemri was the greatest city, ruled over by a dynasty of cruel kings and tyrants. While Nagash’s stolen rule of Khemri is indeed noteworthy, none – apart from the Arch-Necromancer himself – can question that its utmost reign came under High King Settra.\\n\\nBefore the wind of death ravaged Nehekhara, it was an impressive civilisation, a burgeoning realm of rival fiefdoms that saw mankind expand long before Sigmar was even born. But the curse of man, compared to Dwarfs and Elves, is their fleeting existence. Soon the kings and princes of the city-states became obsessed with death, with extending their meagre span. The Mortuary Cult was formed during Settra’s reign and charged with ensuring that mortal bonds would not halt his rule. Settra passed with a curse upon his lips, buried in a grand chamber beneath his mighty pyramid to await the Day of Awakening, when the Mortuary Cult will fulfil their promise and Settra will rise to rule Khemri and dominate all the kingdoms along the Great River Vitae once again. Only modest progress in extending life was made until the rise of Nagash, for it was he who was destined to become the first and greatest of all Necromancers – he who truly brought Unlife to the world.\\n\\nThe tale of Nagash is terrible to behold; needless to say, he was banished from Khemri – and thought destroyed – but many years later rose again and enacted his revenge on all Nehekhara. He cast a great ritual and all the dead in the city-states rose from their ageless slumbers. But this was not the glorious Day of Awakening promised by the Mortuary Cult. The kings awoke entombed in their sarcophagi, breaking free of their burial chambers they saw through empty eye sockets. They had not woken as gods, but were still the rotting mummies that had withered inside their tombs for countless centuries. Some went insane, others remain in denial, but a few were filled with rage at this betrayal. None more so than Settra.\\n\\nNow Settra the Imperishable rules Khemri once more. His Undead legions march at his whim; the King of Kings will not rest until all are under his dominance, be they other, petty Tomb Kings, or the living, whom he despises, for they have something he can never again possess.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_def_hellebron	The Dark Elves were once Asur, the same race as the High Elves. What separates them is that the Druchii unleashed their minds from the iron discipline that all Elves require else they slip into depravity. The Druchii opened their hearts to the gods of the Cytharai, the Elven gods of the Underworld.\\n\\nOf all the underworld gods it was Khaine, God of Murder, who rose to prominence, and especially in Har Ganeth - the City of Executioners. It is a cursed place. A madness overtook that city long ago, a thirst for blood and flesh that has just been kept in abeyance by some of the strictest laws in all Naggaroth. Only in Har Ganeth are acts such as murder, thievery, and public debauchery treated as crimes. The penalty for any infraction is, of course, death by execution. This is a heavy burden to bear for a folk with such a proclivity for violence and homicide; but that is the point, for the slightest leeway would lead to utter depravity and the madness taking hold again.\\n\\nThe release for all this pent-up, violent aggression comes on Death Night, an eve of bloody excess in Khaine's glorious name. As soon as the sun sets, so do the city's draconian laws, and all hell breaks loose as Witch Elves, nobles and even slaves take to the streets to revel in murder. Scores are settled and new ones created in a night of diabolical violence. And only as the dawn gong rings out across the city, and the sated survivors attempt to flee the street, does Har Ganeth’s ruler make an appearance. The gates to the palace swing open and Hellebron, accompanied by her elite guard, emerges to sweep the streets of those engorged and slow with the night’s excesses.\\n\\nHellebron is the Blood Queen, High Priestess of Khaine and most powerful of all Witch Elves. Her only true rival in power is Morathi, whom she despises. For the Witch King’s mother has withheld the secret of eternal youth from Hellebron. And so, while Morathi keeps her eldritch beauty, time leeches upon Hellebron. She becomes a withered crone, and only by bathing in Cauldrons of Blood can she temporarily restore her youthful aspect. But every year, the enchantment wears off quicker and more blood is required. It is this constant attainment to a lost and fleeting beauty that drives the Blood Queen ever onward...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_hef_alarielle	Avelorn lies at the heart of Ulthuan and the Everqueen is its sovereign. Her realm is the principal site of the Earth Mother, and she is regarded as the spiritual leader of the entire Elven realm. The position of the Everqueen is always taken by the previous queen's firstborn daughter, conceived during her year-long ritual marriage to the Phoenix King. After this formal marriage, they are free to take fresh consorts, but only the daughter of the Phoenix King can be the new Everqueen. Hence the queens of Avelorn have always been the Everqueens of Ulthuan, forming an unbroken chain from ages past.\\n\\nAvelorn itself is ancient. Its great forest is the oldest of all Elf realms. Ancient glamours lie upon its tangled groves, and creatures of legend - Treemen, Nymphs and Dryads - still walk beneath its eaves. It is a place of outstanding beauty and visceral danger to intruders, even the monsters that wander down from the Annulii mountains.\\n\\nThe court of the Everqueen is always on the move, travelling through Avelorn from place-to-place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faerie lights flicker in the darkness, illuminating the revels and feasting.\\n\\nAnd yet, to mistake this Everqueen as merely a totem of the Earth Mother, Isha, would be unwise. She has a shrewd grasp of the political games played by Elven royals, and sends her own envoys to the courts - the Handmaidens - to ensure the good of all Ulthuan is upheld when such machinations are underway. And while Everqueens of the past may have avoided the battlefield, Alarielle the Radiant joins the fight without hesitation. Her power drawn from the hearts of all Asur, she is anathema to creatures of fell spirit, and no one can speak falsehood in her presence. So it is that a High Elf army might find glorious aid in its darkest hour, when the Radiant goes to war...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_political_party_hef_alith_anar	Legend has it that, when Malekith fled into the west, the folk of Nagarythe chose Alith Anar as their ruler. The new king was the last heir of a great line, his forebears slain by the Witch King’s minions. In those days there were many Dark Elves still hiding in Ulthuan, and Alith Anar took to eradicating them with a vengeance. Foes not killed in battle were crucified on trees or had their skin stretched across the ragged cliff-faces, where those who passed could witness the insurgents' grisly fate. As Anar attacked and burned each enemy encampment, his infamy grew. He and his loyal warriors struck from the darkness to purge their homeland of traitors and those sympathetic to Malekith. And so the Legend of the Shadow King grew. \\n\\nTo this day, Anar carries a bleak outlook, one which matches the lands over which he reigns, as the Shadowlands, Nagarythe, are dark and desolate places. Nagarythe's jagged coast still bears the scars of the Sundering, yet it is seen as home by the tough, seasoned Shadow Warriors who look upon their kin in the other nine kingdoms with nothing short of utter disdain.\\n\\nAnar himself is a king without a palace, not that he desires a luxurious throne. One of the greatest Elven palaces of all, Anlec, was once capital of Nagarythe and the seat of the first Phoenix king. Now, it lies in ruins, but there have been many attempts by the Druchii and even some Asur to bring it back to past glories. The Shadow King, however, is more comfortable with his warriors in the wilds or even ranging beyond Nagarythe’s borders, to fulfil his eternal quest for vengeance against the traitor-kin who ruined his homeland and slaughtered his bloodline!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_cst_noctilus_ruler	The immortal Vampire Counts of Sylvania – known to most as the Midnight Aristocracy – seldom venture from the comfort of their dank castles and certainly very few have been known to leave their fell feeding grounds for the uncertain life of the sea-borne adventurer. Nyklaus von Carstein, therefore, is something of an anomaly among his kind…\\n\\n The infamous fleet commander now known as Count Noctilus is leader of the Dreadfleet – a malevolent gathering of dissolute (and desiccated) Undead warship captains, including notorious privateers such as the Shadewraith, the Skabrus, the Black Kraken and the Curse of Zandri, among others, who bring abject ruin to the high seas and damnation to living seafarers. Although once a member of Sylvania’s aristocratic Vampire dynasty, he had a markedly different vision from his squabbling peers of how he would achieve Necromantic supremacy. After studying the countless charts which map the ebb and flow of magic across the world, von Carstein realised that by mastering the art of seafaring he would be able to harness the magical gales that whirl and cascade across the oceans.\\n\\n This newfound route to power eventually led him to translocate himself and his Undead minions to the bone-choked morass of the Galleon’s Graveyard, a fell sea-based realm of the Unliving between the tangible and intangible worlds that entraps shipwrecked vessels from across the Great Ocean. It was in this mysterious place that Nyklaus von Carstein founded his darkling empire and renamed himself Count Noctilus.\\n\\nAt the centre of the Galleon’s Graveyard, Noctilus has feasted upon the magic of a sentient whirlpool known as the Maelstrom – a skull-strewn tempest of magic that sucks in shipwrecks, plunder, and drowned sailors from beyond the veil like a giant lodestone. By using the whirlpool’s raw power to draw in the shattered remains of dead warships, he has forged a grotesque seafaring vessel of his own – the Bloody Reaver, an amalgam of rotting galleons and eldritch power upon which sits the dark and jagged crag of his floating castle, standing proudly like a conqueror’s statue! \\n\\nAs the clock strikes midnight, the Dreadfleet heads out to sea, its Undead captains eager to slake their unholy thirsts. Their warships of the damned emerge from banks of sulphurous fog, illuminated only by flickering, pallid ghostlights, drawing closer with the sickening slowness of a recurring nightmare before the silence is broken by the thunderous roar of their lethal broadsides! After each raid, the Dreadfleet disappears back into its watery lair as quickly and silently as it first appeared, far from the reach of the living.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_cst_sartosa_ruler	The most feared of all pirates who menace the waters surrounding the city-port of Sartosa and beyond is the ‘Queen of Tides’, Aranessa Anja Saltspite. Rumour has it that she was not sired by mortal man, but is actually the daughter of the Sea-God Manann, the ‘Seafather’ himself; that she rose fully grown out of the waves in a froth of gore, with seawater flowing through her veins instead of blood. Having been cast out by her Norscan tribe as a baby, she is said to have cut off her own fishtail before heading out to sea to seek her fortune, biding her time until she was strong enough – in every sense – to take her bloody revenge upon the people who left her for dead.\\n\\nWhatever Aranessa’s origins, there can be no doubt that she is greatly favoured by the Sea-God, and that a peculiar connection exists between them, for she has sailed the Great Ocean to the very ends of the world and back, through the most violent of tempests, yet always emerges unscathed. Aranessa knows that it is her duty to protect the Seafather’s realm as he protects her, but the sea is vast, and such a task would take countless lifetimes, so Manann has granted her some of the world’s most powerful seafarers – Vampire Admirals, with whom he has made pacts in exchange for their aid. Aranessa is not entirely comfortable with this alliance, but knows her Necromantic officers are undeniably useful. As Manann washes the corpses of dead sailors against the Swordfysh’s hull and upon the shores of Sartosa, her allies breathe Unlife into them, thus fortifying her crew with shipmates Manann considers more ‘permanent’.\\n\\nAssociations with the Undead aside, those who have met Aranessa and lived say she is a strange character indeed. Peg-legged from her long career as a buccaneer, she has no warmth in her soul and absolutely no love for man. Only the open seas and the glitter of gems can melt her scowl, but as Aranessa’s crew maintain, on those rare occasions where she deigns to smile it is like a new dawn. But what manner of dawn? A dawn of merciless, cutthroat violence, theft and murder, which rages without end – that sort of dawn. Beholden to no man, be he living or dead, Captain Aranessa Saltspite – the self-styled ‘Pirate Queen’ – is every bit as merciless as the Great Ocean itself!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_cst_the_drowned_ruler	Cylostra Direfin is the vengeful spirit who commands the Lamprey, a cursed ship of rotten wood and tattered sails that oft appears out of the raging tempests of the open sea. Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a prima donna of considerable size and with the proverbial ‘artistic temperament’ in spades, who never accepted anything less than having things all her own way. Her great volatility and intimidating demeanour meant that no-one ever dared refuse her demands.\\n\\nUnfortunately for both Cylostra and ultimately the world, she was a passenger aboard the Lamprey during an important diplomatic voyage to perform for the Phoenix King. Amid a gale of truly epic proportions, the Bretonnian galleon went down in a violent electrical storm, drowning everyone on board, but as the legend goes, Cylostra had already usurped the ship’s meek captain before it sank, simply for daring to delay her performance by attempting to circumvent the dangerous weather! In a fit of rage, and demonstrating a near-unnatural physical strength born of her passion for music, she threw him overboard in what was, up to that point in her life, an uncharacteristic act of cold-blooded murder. Ordering the subjugated crew to keep the ship on course directly into the storm, Cylostra’s delusions of grandeur even made her believe that she could demand safe passage from the tempest itself by singing determinedly over the howling gales. Sadly, for her, the elements cannot so easily be tamed. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming.\\n\\nUnder normal circumstances, that would’ve been the end for most beings, but Cylostra’s bloated ego refused Morr’s embrace and she rose again in the ultimate act of diva-like defiance. Now, her tortured soul roams the seas, eternally searching for an appreciative audience. Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears with Cylostra singing upon its bow like a dreadful, Unliving figurehead, her songs of death paralyse all those unfortunate enough to hear them before her Undead crew – whom she refers to rather theatrically as ‘The Drowned’ – appear to drag them down into a watery grave, before they are raised again to join the Madame-Captain’s ratings for a life of unfettered piracy and murder!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_def_lokhir_fellheart_ruler	From the forbidding, blackened towers of their sprawling dread city-port Karond Kar, the Dark Elves – or Druchii, as they are called in the Elven tongue – wile away their extremely long lives indulging in internecine plots, twisted schemes, depraved, debauched acts of all kinds, and of course wanton cruelty, sickening torture and bad, old-fashioned death. With devotions such as these, you would think that a life of adventure on the perilous high seas of the Great Ocean – endlessly fighting, raiding and plundering, at great personal risk – would be far too much like hard work for the hedonistic Druchii. Yet there are some among their number who eschew the decadent lifestyles of their peers, throwing caution, and themselves, to the wind, quite literally.\\n\\nOf course, for many the intention is to escape the dangers of Naggarothi life, where execution or murder, always accompanied by a smile, if not maniacal laughter, are always close by, if not waiting around the next corner. Not so in the case of Lokhir Fellheart – the dreaded ‘Krakenlord’. He was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing death to those stupid enough to attempt to traverse them, and fire, terror and enslavement to unsuspecting foreign shores. Countless ports and coastal cities lie ruined and ablaze in his wake, for Fellheart is the latest in a long line of doom-bringing admirals to command the Black Ark known as the Tower of the Blessed Dread.\\n\\nAs a result of his terrible exploits, Fellheart has accumulated much plunder – wealth beyond measure, in fact – along with far greater glory than all of his forebears combined. More treasure flows through Karond Kar than ever before – of both the shiny sort and the fleshy, enslaved kind – earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the trust, of the city-port’s Dreadlord masters. But that is enough for Fellheart, for he cares little for politics or anything much except loot and plunder and what it can buy him – the loyalty of his Corsairs and the lavish bribes he pays to insalubrious officials that enable him to operate freely. Although he keeps the best pieces for himself, Fellheart is admired by his crew for his generosity, a quality not normally associated with Dark Elves! They also trust him due to the personal courage he displays in battle, a dangerous habit that other Druchii admirals tend to lose as soon as they can, lest their days on account upon the Great Ocean be very few in number!\\n\\nIt is certainly true that the privations of sea-life, including his high-pressure command, have done little to blunt Lokhir Fellheart’s swordplay – he fights as naturally as he reads the oceans. Well aware that the loyalties of pirate crews hold only as long as their captain’s reputation, Fellheart relentlessly slays enemy heroes, tossing their severed heads onto an ever-growing pile, knowing full well that every skull adds another page to the book of his legend and gives mutineers more than a few compelling reasons not to cross swords with their captain!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_political_party_vampire_coast_ruler	Piracy was not Luthor Harkon’s initial career choice. The Vampire, whose origins are shrouded in mystery, was travelling in his sarcophagus across the Great Ocean, aboard an Empire merchant ship, when it was attacked by a band of savage Norscan raiders. Unfortunately for them, in their rabid scramble for loot they prised open Harkon’s burial chest, awakening him from his dreamless slumber. By the time the ship broke up on the rocky Lustrian coastline, all the ‘surviving’ crew had undergone something of a change, in both their allegiance and their vital signs…\\n\\nSince that day, Harkon has ruled the region now known as the Vampire Coast, setting sail upon the Great Ocean in search of loot, plunder, and fresh recruits to raise into his service. As leader of a pirate fleet crewed exclusively by the dead and damned, he holds sway over a sea region of high winds and perilous currents that have proven to be incredibly treacherous to many unwary vessels, swelling his horde of Undead mariners with the reanimated corpses of shipwrecked unfortunates.\\n\\nLuthor Harkon teeters constantly on the very brink of insanity due in no small part to his colossal pride and greed, qualities which on one devastating, fateful occasion led him to almost lose his life as well as his mind, and certainly lost him all of his magical abilities short of the power to raise his minions and bind them to his inexorable will. The story goes that, while on a fateful quest to further augment his already not-inconsiderable might, Harkon attempted to use his Dark Magic to enter a chamber inside a Lizardman temple buried deep within the deadly Lustrian jungle. Powerful glyphs barred his way, but he pushed onwards in spite of the barriers and driven by his fatal flaw – his great arrogance and hubris - causing the magical seals to retaliate and drain his magical power and then his lifeforce, whilst the walls of the ancient ritual chamber began to crumble. With supreme effort, Harkon managed to break free and stagger outside as the passageway collapsed behind him, but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind was shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets which to this day battle for dominance in his mind.\\n\\nIn the years since, the only common goal that Luthor Harkon’s various personalities have been able to work towards is that of finding a cure for his condition. To this end, the Pirate King of the Vampire Coast has bent his obsessions to seizing Slann artefacts in the hope that their power can heal his damaged psyche!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_political_party_lzd_tehenhauin	"The time of the Great Serpent is nigh!"\\n\\nOne of the most significant events in the history of the Lizardmen was the rise of the Skink cult of the Serpent-God, Sotek. Traditionally, the gods of the Lizardmen were, and still are, the Old Ones, said to have come to the world in its primeval era from beyond the stars: such shadowy entities as Tlaxcotl, Chotec, Quatl, Tzunki, Xapati, Huanchi and the inscrutable Tepok, whose decree was for the world to have a central place in their unknowable plans. Sotek was a new god, an upstart god, the 'God of the Skinks', whose fateful prophecy was an obscure cautionary detail known only from a single plaque once kept in the great pyramid-temple of Chaqua, the City of Gold.\\n\\nThe former Mage-Priests of Chaqua had believed the Plaque of Sotek contained the true words of the Old Ones, but tragically did not ponder on them, assuming they spoke of events in the very distant future. Little did they know that Sotek’s prophecy not only predicted the collapse of the Warp gates, but also an imminent cataclysmic invasion of Lustria by the Skaven, starting with a deadly plague sweeping over the land. And so, when a virulent sickness arrived in Chaqua and decimated the population, it was already far too late. Soon, the unprepared Mage-Priests of the temple-city were also overcome by the sickness and perished. With the spawning pools infected and countless Skinks sick or dead, the events prophesized by the Plaque of Sotek had begun. Doom had befallen the City of Gold…\\n\\nThe remaining population of Chaqua were now leaderless, but the few survivors were of the particularly resilient generation of Skinks known as the ‘Red Crests’. The greatest amongst them was an individual with a zeal for slaughtering Skaven very rarely seen in the dispassionate Lizardmen’s ranks – Tehenhauin, the Prophet of Sotek. As his following grew, the Cult of Sotek quickly became the focal point of the Lizardmen’s counter-offensive against the ratmen’s virulent invasion. For Sotek himself is prophesised to be a mighty serpent of such awesome size and appetite that he can swallow the Rat God himself and spend thousands of years digesting him!\\n\\nHaving led the remaining cohorts of Chaqua on a migration ahead of the plague, Tehenhauin triumphantly grasps the Plaque of Sotek as he leads his apostles against Skaven armies wherever he finds them. It seems impossible for a short-lived Skink to attain his lifespan, but it is whispered that as a snake sheds its skin and is renewed, so too does Sotek’s Chosen. The prophecy states that the Serpent-God’s coming shall be heralded by the appearance of his forked tongue in the sky, but also that his invocation can only be made possible by sating his near-boundless appetite for sacrificial offerings. Tehenhauin will not rest until the waters of the River Amaxon run red with sacrificed Skaven blood, empowering Sotek to deliver Lustria from the rodent-spawn once and for all!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc12_political_party_lzd_tiktaqto	"Flying braves, bring wrath from the sky!!"\\n\\nDwelling in the warmer, jungle climes in the southern regions of the world are the ancient societies of the Lizardmen. Often mistook as a single race, these reptilian guardians of Order are composed of several distinct species serving under the enigmatic Slann Mage-Priests. Of all Lizardmen species, the Skinks are the most mentally and physically agile, and on occasion a Skink spawning will not produce an entire cohort from the pools of life as is the norm, but instead only a single Skink will issue forth. These individuals are considered marked by the Old Ones as destined to lead, or otherwise achieve greatness amongst their kind. When such individuals emerge, the Slann Mage-Priests of Lustria make use of them in the Lizardmen chain of command to help achieve their indecipherable ends.\\n\\nTiktaq’to is one such special individual – a cagey but death-defying Skink Chief who has proven himself peerless when it comes to aerial combat and leading bold hit-and-run attacks from the sky. From his outpost in Tlaqua he patrols the Southlands, leading a squadron of flying reptiles, from atop his Terradon, Zwup, through reckless paths of dense vegetation and steep-sided ravines so narrow that the flying beasts brush against the cliff-faces with each flap of their mighty wings. A keen sense of when and where to strike has led Tiktaq’to to countless victories against forces many times the size of his own. His foes always attempt to shoot him and his squadron out of the air as soon as they come within range – a feat easier said than done, since he leads his formations in such breath-taking aerial manoeuvres that they can evade clouds of arrows and emerge unscathed to deliver their own lethal attacks. For his many acts of fearless flying and savage attacks on the Lizardmen’s foes, Tiktaq’to has been named ‘Master of Skies’, a pre-eminent position that has also granted him ownership of the Mask of Heavens – a thrice-blessed heirloom from an elder age, which allows the wearer to meld their consciousness with the minds of the mighty Terradons.\\n\\nTiktaq’to has been sent from Lustria in aid of the Great Plan, leading his squadron across the World Pond to the Southlands – a place of considerable significance to the Lizardmen as it was once a single landmass that included their home continent of Lustria, before Slann manipulation many ages ago divided it in two. As those who have braved both places will attest, this is why the jungles of the Southlands bear so much in common with those of Lustria, both being home to the same reptilian carnivores as well as long-forgotten temple-cities that have fallen off the newly-altered Geomantic Web. With new aeries now established in the ancient ruins of the previously abandoned temple-city of Tlaqua, the Lizardmen’s ancient holdings in the Southlands shall be forsaken no longer. It is the Master of the Skies’ duty to reclaim them, uphold the will of the Old Ones, and destroy all those discordant with the Great Plan!	false

To destroy, one must-must create!"\\n\\nThe black parody of mankind that are the Skaven ultimately embody everything that is wrong with humanity, only more so. Emerging from their subterranean lairs to unleash vicious and inhuman war, they are a nightmare vision – a ravenous horde, a chaotic and rolling tide of verminous ratmen in unimaginably vast numbers.\\n\\nOf all the despicable Skaven clans that torment the world from the sprawling Under-Empire lurking beneath, Clan Skryre are arguably the most influential, and certainly the most feared. This is due to the deranged creations of the clan’s Warlock Engineers, who specialise in an insane blending of magic and arcane technology to produce untold weaponry in their Warpforges beneath their capital, Skavenblight. They are both inventors and sorcerers in their own right, manufacturing and wielding infernal devices capable of fiendish destruction, while also manipulating the Winds of Magic to cast spells and intertwine enchantments into mechanical form. By selling their weird arsenal of devastation to the other clans as quickly as slaves can churn them off the assembly lines, Clan Skryre has grown wealthy and powerful. None dare offend them for fear of ending up at the wrong end of any number of weapons that could melt, blast, desiccate, or otherwise cause a grievous death.\\n\\nWith depravity and intelligence in equal abundance, Ikit Claw has taken Skryre’s blend of science and sorcery to entirely new levels. The most infamous and dreaded of all Warlock Engineers, his experiments have resulted in entire legions of Skavenslaves being blasted to bits – a small price for the sheer power and killing might that he has added to Skryre’s deadly arsenal. In his bloodthirsty quest for destructive knowledge, Ikit has travelled the world, stealing secrets from the mystics of Cathay, studying the dimension-spanning machines of Lustria, and toiling for years alongside the cruel Forgemasters of far off Zharr-Naggrund.\\n\\nIkit was tall and white-furred before a failed experiment exploded and mangled his body, so an intricate iron mask of his own invention now covers his hairless skull and a cunningly wrought exoskeleton aids his withered left side. The iron contraption is run by a Warp-generator, a masterpiece of engineering that siphons the Winds of Magic to also power Ikit’s devilish inventions. Whirring cogs hiss and vent steam as the Chief Warlock moves, clanking like a fully armoured knight. Like all Clan Skryre Warlock Engineers, Ikit has continued to tinker, adding countless upgrades. He wields the crackling blade known as ‘Storm Daemon’, a modified halberd wrapped with copper wire coils set with glowing Warpstone, energised with barely suppressed power drawn from his Warp-generator.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_political_party_lzd_gorrok	"No fear. No pain. More scars for the Old Ones!"\\n\\nSince the days of their creation, the Lizardmen have been at the forefront of the battle for the world’s survival. While much has been lost over the long ages of warfare against the many foes of Order, the Lizardmen still fight on, unleashing their cold-blooded savagery upon any who stand in the way of their sacred mission. Ever-primed for war, the Lizardmen march to battle with armies comprised of titanic reptilian beasts who lumber onto the battlefields surrounded by vicious cohorts on the ground as well as in the sky, all in aid of the Great Plan.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the greatest of the Lizardmen cohorts are stationed at a location of paramount importance to them and their fulfilment of the Old Ones’ will – Itza, the First City. For buried in the labyrinth beneath the primordial temple-city’s wide concourses are vaults containing many of the Old Ones’ creations, including devices of such potential devastation that not even the Slann Mage-Priests dare dwell upon their nature for too long. Itza is also home to the most powerful and ancient practitioners of magic to be found anywhere in the world, most notably the venerable Relic Priest Lord Kroak, whose indomitable spirit has guarded Itza against the return of Chaos ever since the Great Catastrophe. It is not only powerful figures like Kroak who help uphold the Old Ones’ plan, however, for there are other champions at Itza with the same steadfast resolution.\\n\\nAt the apex of Itza’s tallest pyramid is the resting place of the Great White Lizard, Gor Rok. Like all Saurus, Gor-Rok is a fighting machine, a creature wholly purposed for war and the slaughtering of enemies. Unlike most of his species, however, he has albino colourings and is oversized, his heavy frame corded with muscles covered with scales tough enough to deflect all but the most determined of sword thrusts. Indeed, Gor-Rok has survived horrendous wounds and bears monstrous scars, yet never has injury hindered him from duty or prevented him from achieving victory.\\n\\nNow, with his Skink attendants having hefted the Mace of Ulumak upon his shoulder and with the Shield of Aeons strapped to his arm, Gor-Rok has descended from his resting place once again. With Itza and indeed the whole of Lustria suffering new threats, the Great White Lizard is on the prowl. With cold-blooded purpose, he senses his role in the Great Plan: to go where the fighting is thickest and help the Old Ones’ children in battle wherever he can. Those that do not fall beneath the powerful blows of his mace shall be smashed aside by his massive shield, or otherwise brutally crushed beneath his mighty tread.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_political_party_lzd_nakai	Long before the fledging races of Elves, Dwarfs, or men could even stand upright on their own feet, the ancient race known as the Lizardmen had already proven themselves victorious on countless battlefields across the world. Stranded by the starfaring creators known as the Old Ones and left to contemplate a world irrevocably changed over the ages, the Lizardmen nonetheless work tirelessly to fulfil the Great Plan. From timeworn temple-cities deep within the steaming jungles of Lustria they sound the drums of war and bellow with the blood-rage of creatures of a primordial past, marching to battle against the forces of destruction as the ground trembles beneath them.\\n\\nIn addition to the contemplative Slann, the warrior-caste Saurus, and the nimble Skinks that make up the bulk of their societal and military hierarchy, the Lizardmen’s ranks are also bolstered by the imposing Kroxigor – hulking, crocodilian behemoths whose destructive potential make them overwhelmingly effective shock troops. Physical prowess was originally gifted to them for practical necessity, enabling them to be the beasts of burden that constructed the monolithic structures, vast pyramids, and wide plazas of Lustria’s awe-inspiring temple-cities, upon which it is said the Old Ones themselves landed their star-sailing ships. An infrequent spawning, it is rare for more than a handful of Kroxigor to enter the world at the same time, and even rarer for one to become so long-lived that it starts to act autonomously, without the direction of the Skink handlers and overseers.\\n\\nRoaming master-less throughout the world in aid of the Great Plan, the Kroxigor Ancient known as Nakai the Wanderer is a revered creature. He has often been the harbinger of the Lizardmen’s most pivotal battles throughout the ages, famously appearing in times of their greatest need to annihilate their enemies. He is by far the hardiest of any Lizardmen champion – even the twisted, biological warfare of the Skaven has not been able to overcome him, as proved when he managed to defeat the bemuscled Rat Ogre known as the Beast of Clan Pestilens, despite being fever-stricken by its disease-ridden splatter. Nakai is enigmatic even to his fellow kin – regarded by them as a powerful jungle-spirit and their mightiest protector. He is festooned with golden tributes, for a millennia his victories have often led to the Skink Priests adorning his massive, battle-scarred body with ceremonial tokens as a mark of deference, before he heads off once again to continue his search for those foes who dare defile the hallowed realm of the Lizardmen.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_political_party_wulfhart_ruler	"Civilisation shall triumph over the wilderness. Man shall triumph over beast."\\n\\nFor two and a half millennia, the Empire has formed a bulwark against the encroaching forces of Destruction. Lying at the heart of the Old World, it is the greatest and most powerful of all the nations forged by men. Yet across its lands, evil always lurks in its shadiest corners and darkest depths. Mutant monsters prowl its dark forests, malevolent ratmen plot beneath its cities, and the living dead rise from its graveyards. Monstrous enemies gaze belligerently across its borders, with the threat of invasion from any number of murderous abominations an ever-present danger.\\n\\nYet it endures, for mankind has a steely determination not merely to live, but to thrive. Ever since the legendary warrior Sigmar first united the primitive man-tribes against their common enemies, the longevity of the Empire has been assured by great men hailing from across its provinces.\\n\\nOut of the forests of Middenland emerged Markus Wulfhart, who rose to prominence to become the finest scout in all the Empire. Once a lowly huntsman, his life was irrevocably shattered when a one-eyed Bonegrinder Giant razed his hometown of Drakenburg to the ground, slaughtering its inhabitants. Burning with the desire for revenge, the young hunter tracked the monster to its lair and skilfully blinded it with a single shot from his bow, before severing its rope-like hamstrings with his blade. Closing in on the crippled giant, he hacked at its neck repeatedly with manic determination and decapitated it.\\n\\nMarkus had slain the beast that had murdered his kin, but in suffering the tragedy of losing his entire village he had been set on a new, death-strewn path. He swore that as long as he still lived, no other settlement would suffer the fate of Drakenburg, and he set out to hunt the various monsters that preyed on the Empire. Only when every last one of them was slain would he rest. In recognition of his deeds, Markus was offered a knighthood and a nobleman’s estate by Karl Franz himself. Wulfhart declined, wishing only to be allowed to continue with his self-imposed quest. Impressed with his grim fortitude, the Emperor bestowed unto Markus the title of Huntsmarshal – the Emperor’s Captain of Scouts.\\n\\nAnswering only to the Emperor himself, Markus leads an elite, hand-picked regiment of scouts and hunters from across the land – a disparate group in which city-born men rub shoulders with those raised in rural backwaters. One thing is certain, however – Wulfhart’s hunters are the most accomplished group of monster-slayers in the Empire.	false

Bretonnia is a realm of dukedoms founded upon the heroic ideals of valour, honour and chivalry, whose righteous warriors strive to sweep aside evil on the field of battle in the name of the Lady of the Lake, and for the glory of duke and king.\\n\\nIt is said that in the darkest times of the most bitter struggles, the world’s greatest heroes and heroines are born. Many years ago, vast Chaos hordes sailed in from beyond the Sea of Claws to mercilessly lay waste to Bretonnia. The raiders besieged Couronne and marauded throughout the countryside, hacking down the great Knights bravely opposing them as they went. It was amid the smoking ruins of a small village in neighbouring Lyonesse left in their wake, that the miraculous rise of a humble shepherdess rekindled the broken spirits of Bretonnia’s battered Knights, coalescing them into the legendary war host known as ‘Chevaliers de Lyonesse’.\\n\\nThe shepherdess’ name was Repanse, a peasant who had received a vision from the Lady of the Lake, beseeching her to rid the land of its foul foes. Though no more than seventeen years of age, Repanse’s deep piety compelled her to don the armour of a slain Knight, grab the reins of a rider-less warhorse, and appropriate a sword taken from her village’s grail chapel. Charging out against the ensuing Chaos hordes, her sheer courage inspired the downtrodden Knights to follow. Repanse went on to behead the ruinous Chaos Lord of the invading forces herself, proving beyond measure that the Lady favoured her, and in the process securing her status as a living saint of miraculous longevity.\\n\\nAs the Forces of Destruction continue to terrorise the Old World and beyond, the Lady has seen fit to invoke her saintly champion Repanse once more; in her name, the Damoiselle de Guerre shall ride out to trample evil under the hooves of her mighty warhorse wherever she may find it!	false

The darker half of the Elven race, who sundered many centuries prior, the Dark Elves, watch the world with malevolent eyes, having suffered the greatest betrayal to ever occur in all the ages of the world. To the Druchii, it is their birthright to enslave and rule, and the destiny of others to serve – if indeed they are permitted to survive at all!\\n\\nOf the fortified Dark Elf cities that dominate the Land of Chill, Hag Graef is perhaps the most sinister and foreboding of them all. Also known as “The Dark Crag”, the city is built at the bottom of a cold, dark canyon and is completely surrounded by mountains of bare rock that stretch into the clouds to cast permanent shadows over its black towers and walkways. Driven by the wealth of its bountiful mines, Hag Graef has reaped vast riches from the labour of numberless slaves who claw iron and jet-black stone from the belly of the world for the arsenals of the Witch King, thus solidifying its position as Naggaroth’s second city. With such wealth at stake, Hag Graef’s nobles are constantly at one another’s throats, a situation perpetuated by Malekith himself – after all, if the Dreadlords of the Dark Crag were to unite in common purpose, they would undoubtedly be able to overthrow him. Intrigue, betrayal and murder are rife, not helped by the generally cramped conditions of the city, which combined with the Dark Elves’ peremptory nature ensure that rivalries flair into bloody violence with alarming regularity.\\n\\nIt was in this brutal crucible that Malus Darkblade made his name and earned his reputation as the “Tyrant of Hag Graef”, playing the deadly game of politics for many years and excelling at it. Even by the standards of Hag Graef’s warring families, he is ambitious beyond reason. It was Malus’ very own depthless thirst for power that once led him into the clutches of a being even darker than he, a series of events that resulted in his fate being inexorably intertwined with that of the Daemon Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, who is imprisoned within his very soul.\\n\\nRelying on his own dark determination and limitless reserves of hatred to overcome any opposition, Malus also perseveres through his torment to draw upon Tz’arkan’s frightening power when needed, carrying out the bidding of the Witch King as he hacks a path of bloody ruin across the world.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_political_party_skv_snikch	Across the surface of the world, alliances are severed, plagues are spread and wars are started – all orchestrated by a shrouded and impalpable menace that lurks undetected beneath the very feet of those they conspire to destroy. They are the Skaven – evil ratmen who seek to rule supreme from their sprawling Under-Empire. Gnawing at the roots of the world, they are guided by the furtive intentions of the Council of Thirteen and their malevolent god known as the Great Horned Rat, who forever scratches at the fabric separating the material world from the great beyond. The Skaven Under-Empire consists of countless clans, each one – just like each individual Skaven – jostling for position, status and power. Though the lesser Warlord Clans are a thriving mass of betrayals and broken alliances, the Greater Clans are near-unassailable in this never-ending race. \\n\\nShrouded in shadow and mystery, Eshin is by far the most nefarious of the Greater Clans, feared as murderers and for the art of stealthy death that they have long mastered from their past contact with the Far East. They are silent stalkers, more than capable of infiltrating defences and getting past any number of guards or traps to reach their objectives. For the right price, Clan Eshin will slay any rival, steal any information or commit any act of sabotage required. No warlord wants to be targeted by their shady contracts, and the mere mention of their black-clad killers is enough to make anyone look over his shoulder.\\n\\nThere are many Clan Eshin agents scattered across the clan strongholds and even within the cities of the surface-dwellers, but the one known as Deathmaster Snikch is truly the most dreaded figure of speculation. The deeds and whereabouts of Eshin’s most deadly killer are but rumours that echo throughout the Under-Cities across the world, suiting Lord Sneek, the Grand Nightlord of Clan Eshin and member of the Lords of Decay – because as long as no-one knows Snikch’s real location, then no one can ever feel truly safe. The ramifications of such mystique are always considered by Clan Eshin and the Council of Thirteen. Once deployed, Deathmaster Snikch does not fail, but the list of targets always grows more quickly than even this perfect killer can eliminate them. In times when he has been unleashed upon the world by his master, it has always been impossible for anyone to divine his presence. While a master of murder, it is likely that Snikch is also behind many of the ratmen’s most devious acts of sabotage; great fires, heinous bombings, the failure of war machines on the eve of tide-turning battles – who knows how many of the world’s pivotal disasters were really the work of Snikch?	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_political_party_grn_grom	"Find da pointy-‘eads! Give ‘em a proper fight! WAAAGH!"\\n\\nOrcs and Goblins are a bane to civilisation, raiding ceaselessly and carrying war and barbarism to every corner of the world. Collectively known as Greenskins, time and again they amass without warning, their direction and intent utterly fickle and unpredictable. Their hodgepodge armies are typically a whole slew of violent-minded creatures, monsters and critters dominated by a single Orc or Goblin. For one of the latter to lead due to being "da biggest" is unheard of, which makes the story of the tribe known as Broken Axe notable due to the remarkable rise and feats of its Goblin Warboss, Grom the Paunch.\\n\\nGrom was once a young Boss of the Broken Axe Goblins – a little-known, backwards mob from dismal surroundings. He began his rise to fame after consuming a large quantity of raw Troll meat during a wager. By all rights the regenerating flesh should have killed him, but he had always been a big eater, and after days of chronic indigestion and profuse flatulence Grom found he was able to digest the meat at roughly the same rate at which it grew back – so long as he kept eating excessively. A grossly fat and even stronger Grom heroically emerged, his new expansive proportions rivalling that of even the biggest Orcs. Using his newfound bulk, he worked his way to the top of the Broken Axe tribe before conquering many other Orc and Goblin mobs. Grom’s trail of destruction continued through the realms of Dwarfs and men, his horde swelling to unfathomable numbers as countless Greenskins flocked for a share of his battle glory. Following a trance-prophecy from his Shaman Ol’ Blacktoof, Grom took his massive host to sea, fortuitously landing on a mysterious shingle beach wreathed in mist – this was Ulthuan, along the bleak coast of Yvresse.\\n\\nThe maniacal Shaman claimed the High Elves’ realm was a land that Gork and Mork wanted conquered, and Grom obliged. The hopelessly outnumbered High Elves could do little to stop his rampage inland. Eventually, he reached a city to conquer worthy of his reputation; a beautiful metropolis that rivals any ever built, Tor Yvresse. Grom’s overwhelming Waaagh! flooded in, cackling as the flames went higher and pausing to rip the arms off statues, torment injured Elves and barbarically smash any symbols of civilisation they could find. Then, just as the city was on the verge of complete destruction, down from the skies upon a mighty Griffon hurtled Eltharion, an Elven captain of renown. Fighting with vengeance in his eyes, he eventually beheaded Blacktoof with a single sword stroke. With the death of Broken Axe’s chief Sorcerer and the arrival of Eltharion’s battle-hardened reinforcements, Broken Axe’s horde started to rout as a storm raged overhead. Grom attempted to rally his shaken troops in vain, until he too finally fled.\\n\\nWith the ignominy of defeat a not-so-distant memory, the proclaimed King of the Goblins hungers still – both for anything he can get in his mouth, and the glories of conquest. In time, Grom’s Waaagh! shall amass once again and return to claim "da biggest prize"!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_political_party_hef_eltharion	"Tor Yvresse will never fall as long as I still live."\\n\\nFrom the ten kingdoms of Ulthuan, the High Elves march to war. For millennia they have stood guard over the world, defending it from the predations of Daemons, the worshippers of unholy Gods, and the unthinking meddling of lesser races. Their existence is one of eternal battle, fought with a courage that only they possess. When the Phoenix King issues the call to war, his people gladly answer, for it is not in the High Elves’ nature to pass so easily into history at the hands of their enemies, as they defend their island-haven to the last.\\n\\nOn the east coast of Ulthuan is the misty land of Yvresse, a land of mountain foothills, deep coniferous forests and towering cliffs. To many it is considered a bleak coastal realm, but those who call it home see it is as a place as fine as any on the continent; a place of great significance to the whole of Ulthuan due to its eastern position, shielding the haven’s coast from intruders from the Old World. Its Shifting Isles, a cluster of islands just off the coast of Yvresse’s mainland, is an area shrouded in legend. Ancient spells of illusion keep the area covered in mist and each islet is seldom encountered twice in the same spot. This creates treacherous mazes of shoals and sandbars which confuse even High Elf sailors. Yvresse’s only major city is Tor Yvresse, a metropolis which was once as beautiful and grand as any of the Elf cities of old. In the present day, however, many of its mansions are uninhabited and its great amphitheatres stand silent and empty. Its thick, reinforced walls are mighty and deep, but there will likely never be enough warriors to hold them. The tragedy of near annihilation still weighs heavily on the city’s heart, after the wicked Goblin they know as Grom the Paunch invaded long ago. His stupendous horde inflicted unimaginable losses upon the High Elves as he brought the city to its knees.\\n\\nTor Yvresse’s story would surely have ended with desolation at Grom’s hands were it not for the heroics of one of the greatest Elven generals, Eltharion the Grim. At the crucial moment of the invasion, Eltharion and his hardened troops arrived during the city’s darkest hour to turn the tide of battle against monumental odds. Grom’s army was routed, with the obese Goblin himself chased out of Yvresse. Eltharion, newly-elected as the Warden of Tor Yvresse, followed in his wake, sweeping through the Badlands like a wind of blades to slaughter Warbosses and topple Greenskin fortresses wherever he encountered them. But Grom had escaped, and worse still, Eltharion learned that his reputation had spread so far and wide that Warbosses were actually seeking him out, knowing that "Pointy-‘ead" would "give ‘em a proper fight."\\n\\nReturning to Tor Yvresse, Eltharion began to train its armies and fortify the city as never before. The next time a Waaagh! lands on the shores of Ulthuan, the folk of Yvresse – and their grim Warden – will be ready for them.	false

On their fair isle of Ulthuan in the centre of the Great Ocean, they are far removed from the petty squabbles of the lesser races, practicing magic and the advanced arts of warfare. They train eternally for war, repelling the unending barrage of piracy and raids targeted at their home continent from all malevolent forces. All the while, Malekith and the exiled Dark Elves seek to lay claim to the Phoenix Throne, posing a real and constant threat.\\n\\nCaledor is a mountainous, thinly-populated realm of Ulthuan where mighty Dragons dwell beneath the peaks in an endless slumber. Once, none could stand against Caledor’s Dragon-borne warriors and fearsome Mages in battle, as they soared above the thermals of their land’s sullen volcanoes. Their ruling noble house traces its bloodline back to one of the mightiest ancient Mages, Caledor Dragontamer. Not only was he responsible for the creation of the Great Vortex, but it was also he who first bound the fearsome Drakes of the land to his will. The land took the great Mage’s name, and the distinguished line of the House of Caledor would ascend to the Phoenix Throne only two generations later, after the Phoenix King was poisoned by Malekith in his attempts to seize the throne. With the majority of the noble Princes massacred by Malekith’s followers, Caledor the Conqueror, grandson of Dragontamer, ascended amidst the beginnings of an age of tragedy and conflict. In an eventful reign, he led a fraught but successful defence of Ulthuan from Malekith’s early attempts to reclaim it.\\n\\nThe lineage and history of the Dragon Princes of Caledor are great and the martial powers they wrought had previously long been unmatched. But the fury of the land’s volcanoes eventually ebbed and as the peaks lost their fire, the Dragons drifted into slumber becoming ever more difficult to rouse. As the prominence of the Dragons waned, so did the power of the haughty Caledorian Princes, whose grip on the Phoenix Throne slackened and their kingdom drifted out of importance.\\n\\nImrik is the last of the line of Caledor Dragontamer and Caledor the Conqueror, and the highest noble amongst the current Dragon Princes. Leading the knights of the House of Caledor, he remains one of the few that can wake the Dragons in times of need. Gone are the days when his followers rode into battle atop mighty Fire Drakes, yet Imrik alone fights in the traditional manner of Caledor upon his majestic and fanatically-loyal Dragon, Minaithnir. And fight he does, standing in defence of his homeland and all Ulthuan together with Tyrion and Teclis, themselves descendants of the great house of Aenarion.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_political_party_skv_throt	“It-it lives!!!”\\n\\nDeep underground, closer to the world’s bowels than any manmade tunnel or sewer, lives a race of bipedal ratmen that are so rarely seen that many deny their very existence save for those unfortunate enough to have encountered them. They are the Skaven, an evil force unlike any other, watching and waiting impatiently to unleash vicious and inhuman war, yet biding its time. They are arguably the most numerous of all the races, remaining hidden in sprawling burrows beneath unsuspecting kingdoms as well as in their own lairs below abandoned cities or within old mountain Holds wrested from ousted Dwarfs. They are ruled by a treacherous hierarchy of innumerable clans, but none hold as much power or influence as the four Greater Clans, each of which exerts a great deal of influence due to varying degrees of technological, economic and military power.\\n\\nPerhaps the most innovative of the Greater Clans, owing to the tireless work of its Master Mutators, Clan Moulder rose to infamy by mastering the art of breeding, mutating, and creating monstrous fighting beasts through surgery. It is not known how disparate parts of mutated creatures are stitched together, for its methods are jealously guarded. It is no secret, however, that Clan Moulder is one of the wealthiest of all clans, for its heinous creations are sold to others eager to boost their fighting prowess by adding swarms of Giant Rats, packs of towering Rat Ogres, or perhaps something even more bizarre to their ranks. A portion of many a Warlord’s military strength was birthed in Hell Pit, the loathsome stronghold of Clan Moulder.\\n\\nOne of the most twisted and ingenious of Moulder’s Master Mutators is Throt the Unclean, whose successes in the art of monster creation and augmentation has earned him a position as one of the infamous nine Lords of Hell Pit. The effects of a lifetime’s work with Warpstone can be seen, as bone spines protrude out of Throt’s back and a third arm sprouts from his bloated but powerful frame. Over many self-developmental experiments, he has radically sped up his own metabolism and grows ravenously hungry after any exertion – it is the Black Hunger, only worse, requiring him to consume more than four times his own body weight daily to avoid being ravaged by his own Warp-enhanced constitution. Throt’s rise to power has been marked by an ability to create and lead any number of bloodthirsty creatures to battle, along with a knack for capturing new beasts upon which to experiment. Whether it is obtaining Blindwyrms, discovering applications for Trollspleen, or cultivating the best ‘growing juices’ with which to increase the size of Rat Ogres, very few others can match Throt’s extremely distasteful and dastardly deeds.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_political_party_wef_drycha	“The Children of Isha will fail us!”\\n\\nThe Treeman Ancients were the first magical beings encountered by the Elves of Ulthuan at the very beginning of their history, powerful spirits whose essences had long ago merged with living trees in bonds that only death can sever. The Wood Elves tell that there were once hundreds of such beings, but the collapse of the great polar gates and the coming of Chaos saw many perish in the fight against the Daemonic hosts, before the conjuring of the Great Vortex led to the withering of Daemonkind. Though many Treemen endured the bitter struggle against the Dark Gods, the vast majority of survivors were younger striplings, and only three of the eldest Ancients survived – Adanhu, Durthu, and Coeddil. They are known as the Elders, Treemen whose age is beyond mortal reckoning.\\n\\nFor long centuries before the coming of the Elves to Athel Loren, the Elder known as Coeddil was responsible for the many manifestations of the forest’s wrath against its despoilers. When a pact was made by Durthu that would ensure the forest’s symbiotic relationship with the Wood Elves, the distrustful Coeddil was consumed with bitter fury and demanded the interlopers instead be slain. Overruled by his fellow Elders, Coeddil’s resentment for the Wood Elves’ presence eventually drove him to a great betrayal, when centuries later he strode into their glade with his wargrove of Dryad handmaidens to slaughter all he could find. It was an act met with all the rage and awesome power of the Elven Mage Queen Ariel, against which Coeddil and his followers could not withstand. Unable to slay him due to her soul’s binding to Athel Loren’s spirits, Ariel imprisoned the wrathful Elder in the Wildwood, a dark corner of the forest where no Elves dwell. Encircling it with Waystones, Coeddil was abandoned amongst the shadow-glades to brood upon his betrayal.\\n\\nThough Coeddil remains trapped in the Wildwood’s depths, his malevolent will still manifests itself through the actions of his herald, the most spiteful of all Dryads – Drycha, the Briarmaven of Woe. Here are two embittered spirits of common cause, for like the great Elder himself, Drycha remembers well the days before the coming of the Elves and has ever rued the folly that shackled the forest to mortal whim and fate. In the early years of the alliance, she was ever in evidence about the glades and groves, watching the Elves and examining their every action for any sign of betrayal. Though she has been seen little in more recent times, strange tales have emerged around Athel Loren –  worrying tales of Drycha’s activities. Amongst the men of the Empire and Bretonnia, rumours abound of trees that come alive, unprovoked yet hungry for blood, leaving settlements ruined and their inhabitants as no more than scraps of tattered flesh. These may seem like senseless events, but there must surely be a greater goal behind Drycha’s activities than mere slaughter, though what that goal might be remains to be seen. 	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_political_party_wef_sisters_of_twilight	"Pure as starlight…\\n\\n…Wild as Flame!"\\n\\nFor thousands of years, the Wood Elves have lived in harmony with the sentient forest of Athel Loren and the spirits which dwell beneath its boughs. Like all Elves, their origins can be traced back to the cradle of Ulthuan, but the Asrai, as they would come to be known, splintered from their ancestral home long before the acts of jealously and spite which led to the Sundering and on to the beginnings of the age-old conflict between their High Elf and Dark Elf cousins.\\n\\nInitially inhabitants of an Elven colony on the fringes of Athel Loren, the Asrai forged an alliance with the powerful spirits of the forest after Ariel, the foremost amongst their magi, learned the art of tree-singing and became the first to speak to the forest. Thus it was that Athel Loren opened up its many secrets to the Elves who made it their home, treating the forest with the awe and reverence it deserved and demanded, seeing the essence of their ancestral gods in its seasonal cycles. Through the mysterious power of the Oak of Ages, the spiritual heart of Athel Loren, Ariel acquired the aspects of Isha, the ancient Elven goddess of nature to become a Mage Queen, ruling over the Asrai alongside her consort Orion, a demigod in his own right. Despite being powerful beings, the King and Queen in the Woods do not seek to act as the world’s protectors, nor enthrone themselves as its rulers, but there are times when Ariel’s will must shape the fortunes of other lands for a greater purpose. Never has this been truer than in these dark days, where every broken bough or withered leaf carries an omen of darker times to come.\\n\\nTo assist her, Ariel sends forth her emissaries Naestra and Arahan, twin maiden sisters who can only be told apart by the shade of their hair and their contrasting temperaments. Naestra has a spirit as pure as starlight, seeking out battle only in pursuit of preventing greater harms, while Arahan is as wild as an unbridled flame, welcoming it with wanton joy. Despite the sisters’ different outlooks on war, many a foe has fallen before them in battle. Not only are their armaments crafted by Lord Daith himself, the most celebrated of Elven smiths, but they can only be defeated if both are felled in quick succession, for the ancient magics of the forest mean that the harms inflicted upon one twin are inconsequential as long as the other still draws breath. None save for Ariel herself know the sisters’ true origins, with some stories claiming that they share her divinity, or that they are her daughters and therefore princesses of Athel Loren by blood.

As Chaos flowed across the veils of space and time into the world at large, from the skies came pulsing comets of wyrdling stone that pounded the land as if the fists of the Gods themselves struck the earth. Huge chunks of solidified Chaos energy buried themselves inside massive craters of scorched earth. As the land was infected by the raw stuff of Chaos, its insidious taint worked outward into the fertile soil to be suckled upon by the roots of ancient trees and breathed in deeply by the beasts that populated those realms. Strange and terrible processes were enacted in that dank, boiling cauldron of fecundity – the primitives of the region and beasts of the forests were somehow mated, their terrible offspring born and mated again. Generation after generation came into being, indiscriminately reproducing and dying in an uncontrolled, rapid procession. Thus, the race of Beastmen was born. Willingly embracing their Ruinous heritage, they sport the basic intelligence of men combined with the base cunning of wild animals. The Beastmen lack even a shred of nobility and compassion, belonging utterly to the Dark Gods in both body and soul.\\n\\nThere is perhaps no Cloven One in thrall to the Ruinous Powers as deeply as Taurox, the Brass Bull. Once a fearsome chieftain of the Minotaur tribes, Taurox’s path was forever changed when he devoured the head of an emissary of Chaos who had crawled into the mortal realm through one of Taurox’s slain rivals. He was immediately shaken with visions of the world awash with blood and afloat with corpses. Roaring and screaming in convulsion, he took up his axes and slayed every single one of his tribe. But he did not stop there. For a year and a day, Taurox raged across the lands in a blind rampage, killing every living thing he could find. Tribes of Beastmen, covens of witches, mercenary Ogres, Imperial patrols, proud Bretonnian Knights, two-headed Giants – all fell to Taurox’s boundless wrath. After slaughtering almost the entire population of the vale of Lietberg, he finally collapsed into the crimson stream of blood that flowed at his feet, his energies completely spent.\\n\\nBut the Dark Ones had seen Taurox's rampage, and still had use for him. Under a scarlet moon, he was reborn with a body of shining metal, as the reward for his fell deeds committed in their Ruinous names. No more would he tire, just as no more would he have a moment’s respite from the rage which consumed him. So Taurox set off once more and began his slaughter anew. With turbulent visions sent to him by the Dark Gods as guidance, the Brass Bull will stop at nothing, until his foes can somehow find a way to put him the grave once and for all!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc17_political_party_dwarf_thorek	"The Ancestors smile upon our quest — now let us make them proud!"\\n\\nLoyal, resolute and strong, the Dawi, as the Dwarfs refer to themselves, descend from a lineage marked out by greatness. During their long and storied history, they ruled an empire stretching out across the Old World, holding most of the land in their iron grip; the finest miners, craftsmen and warriors all hailed from their mighty Halls. Now, while their skills are no less coveted, the Dwarfs once glorious empire has long since crumbled amidst centuries of war, and the vast treasures they once held lie scattered among their numerous enemies. The years since have seen many of the great Holds, that were once centres of culture and industry, fall to the relentless onslaught of their foes. They now lie in ruin, and only a few remain standing as the last bastions of the ancient Dawi homeland. But all is recorded in the Dammaz Kron; within the Book of Grudges is written every slight the Dwarfs have suffered, to one day be avenged by the proud sons of Karaz Ankor.\\n\\nThere are none more proud than Thorek Ironbrow, the Master Runelord of Karak Azul. A staunch traditionalist and defender of the old ways, Thorek maintains that only by looking to the glorious image of the past will the Dawi finally be able to carve out a future. It is the weapons forged the old way, under his strict tutelage, that the warriors of Karaz Ankor wield to defend the realm. Thorek is no stranger to battle either. In times of great need, he will join the fray beside the Anvil of Doom, and smite the foes of the Dawi with his formidable runed hammer Klad Brakak. And it is clear such times of need are at hand.\\n\\nUnder the instruction of the High King, the Runelord has assembled an expedition force and journeyed to the unfamiliar landscape of the New World. It is written in the Book of Grudges, that there among the dense jungles of Lustria will be found the most powerful of stolen Relics — Artefacts of the Ancestors which must be reclaimed! With their strength, Thorek is certain that the ancient glory of the Dwarfs may yet still be reclaimed. Though the New World is strange and alien, brimming with threats both new and old, he remains unshaken. Nothing will stand between him and the task of recovering what once was lost. There are Grudges to be stricken from the Dammaz Kron, and past wrongs to be set right. By the will of the Ancestors, Thorek Ironbrow is determined to take back what is rightfully theirs, and finally restore the legacy of their wonderous past once and for all.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_dlc17_political_party_lzd_oxyotl	"I have existed in the full horror of Chaos.\\nI have glimpsed firsthand the fate of all races of the world.\\nThe Dark Gods must not prevail."\\n\\nMany aeons ago, the continent of Lustria was the realm of the creator-gods – the mysterious Old Ones, who ruled with the Lizardmen as their servants to have the world fulfill its unique, boundless potential. This world was not their only dominion; the Old Ones’ empire spanned not only space, but also time itself. One day, disaster befell them. The dimensional pathways and gateways they used to travel collapsed, as destructive beings who dwelled in the darkling halls and stygian depths were stirred from their in-between realm – malign intelligences that resented the Old Ones’ trespasses, forces the creator-gods had long fought in a constant war for mastery over that impossible dimension. Thus, Chaos gained entry into this reality and the Old Ones departed, never to be seen again. Whether they were destroyed, or simply abandoned the world to its fate, none will ever know. The Slann, Skinks, Saurus and all other castes of Lizardmen spawned to further the work of their creators had a new purpose: to be the defenders of the world.\\n\\nOxyotl was already an accomplished hunter when Chaos arrived, leading successful ambushes against the oncoming hordes with his fellow Chameleon Skinks. After his Slann Lord was tricked by the Ruinous Powers, the colossal energies with which the Old Ones tried to banish the foe spiralled out of control, ripping holes in the fabric of reality itself. The Slann Lord and his Chameleon Skink protectors were sucked into the Realm of Chaos and Oxyotl awoke in a living nightmare. His Lord and spawn-kin were devoured and he was alone in a land of living shadows, untruths and impossibilities. Using his innate abilities, he was able to stay mostly unnoticed, still having to fight to survive using his instincts and cunning. He covered his scent against the Daemonic hounds tracking him by daubing himself in his pursuers’ blood, and ambushed the mystic sentinels that sought to destroy him. Most miraculously of all, the Chameleon Skink successfully willed himself to resist all temptations.\\n\\nAfter trials almost beyond enduring, Oxyotl found a path home, passing through fell places that he cannot recount even to himself for fear of going mad. The passage of time flows strangely within the Realm of Chaos, and upon his return to Lustria he found that over 7000 years had passed, during which the Lizardmen’s realm had fallen low and the lesser races had spread like plagues. Since his return, Oxyotl has waged a war of revenge against the fell powers. Some say his experiences changed him irrevocably, allowing him to foresee the presence of the Dark Gods’ minions before they execute their destructive schemes. Time after time, the Daemons arrive to find Oxyotl already ensconced nearby, a hidden nuisance that always finds a way to thwart their immortal plans. After each great deed, he fades back into the jungle, perhaps already en route to where he is needed next.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_def_malekith	"If they shall not bow to me, the rightful ruler of Ulthuan, then I shall see each tower crumble and every soul scourged in pain until they beg for my rule."\\n\\nLong ago, the near-immortal Elves were a single race, united in outlook. Then came a great divide, when avarice, jealousy and malevolence boiled over and forever tore apart their civilisation. Denied the throne and then rejected by the god Asuryan’s purifying flames, Malekith, rightful son of Aenarion, has declared himself forever the enemy of Ulthuan and the Asur.\\n\\nAlthough Malekith’s broken body was healed by his mother, the Hag Sorceress Morathi, using magical means, he remains scarred from the encounter and twisted by an inalienable desire to avenge himself upon those once considered kin. There are none among the Druchii – Malekith’s Elven supporters – who have seen his face, for his entire body lies encased within a suit of enchanted, black-metal armour said to be fused to his flesh. Many among the Druchii even mutter that Morathi’s Dark Magic has rendered her son immortal. Whether or not this is true, Malekith promises dire vengeance upon the Asur, vowing to wipe Ulthuan forever from the face of the world if he is denied the Phoenix Throne again.\\n\\nDeep within the Dark Elves’ bleak kingdom of Naggaroth, plans are afoot to bring about the High Elves’ downfall. To this end, Malekith has spent centuries training to become the perfect warrior, a much-dreaded sorcerer, and an ‘inspirational’ leader, although fear of the ‘Witch King’, as he is now known is, in many cases, the galvanising element.\\n\\n Malekith’s forces have followed him across the world in pursuit of his dark goal, and have faced the High Elves on many occasions; in spite of this, Ulthuan still stands. Nothing if not persistent, Malekith knows that soon there will be a final reckoning between the Elves – the Druchii will rise, the Asur will fall, and the work of millennia will at last be complete. If the Witch King cannot rule Ulthuan, then no one will!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_def_morathi	"They will betray you, my son, they always do. Let me end them first."\\n\\nAll Elves were once as one, living in contentment in their island paradise of Ulthuan. Alas, nothing endures forever. The Daemons came and Aenarion strode forth to vanquish them. At first a mighty hero… then he drew the Sword of Khaine and doomed his line.\\n\\nThe Daemons were banished, the Great Vortex created, but in victory came the Elves’ ultimate defeat. A schism was rent between those who had been most loyal to Aenarion’s line, and the rest of Ulthuan. Soon Elf fought Elf and the Dark Elves, or, more accurately, the Druchii, were forged in war, blood and murder. The events that led to this sundering happened millennia ago, and yet, the grand architect of a whole race’s tragedy not only still lives but remains one of the most powerful of all their rulers. She is the mother of the Witch King; she is Morathi, the Hag Sorceress of Ghrond.\\n\\nMorathi was Aenarion’s second wife. He rescued the beautiful seeress from a Slaaneshi host. As the legends tell it, they soon fell in love, and Morathi’s influence became absolute. Through their union came a son, Malekith, destined to become the Witch King. This alone guarantees Morathi a place in history, but she is far more than a mother alone. It was Morathi that broke apart the magical spectrum to fashion Dark Magic. It was she that spread the Cult of Pleasure throughout Ulthuan, fermenting the seeds of discord and ensuring that Malekith’s followers were ready when he made his move against the usurpers of Ulthuan.\\n\\nTo this day, Morathi is both revered and hated by her own kin. While the Witch King tolerates his mother, she is more likely to be manipulating events that furnish her own agenda. Seduction and assassination are her favoured weapons, although she is no stranger to open war. Over millennia the Cult of Pleasure’s influence has waxed and waned, but it has always remained under Morathi’s sway. And so - even as Malekith banishes the Hag Sorceress away from the traditional powerbase of Ghrond to the Ancient City of Quintex - her followers are ready and waiting.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_hef_teclis	"With Moon Staff and Sword, I am master of magics and shaper of fates. Destiny beckons and I must heed the call."\\n\\nThe High Elves – or Asur as they call themselves – are among the oldest civilisations in the world; possibly, only the jungle-dwelling Lizardmen can lay claim to a longer existence. Although mortal, Elves lead incredibly long lives; so long, in fact, that the spans allotted to men seem to be as fleeting as those of mayflies. From their island fortress-paradise of Ulthuan near the centre of the world, the High Elves – although aloof and arrogant in their manner – have generally walked the path of Order, using their longevity to become warriors without peer and mages without equal.\\n\\nAs descendants of Aenarion, the first Phoenix King, the twin brothers Tyrion and Teclis were marked for greatness from the moment they were born, like all of his line. Whereas Tyrion is renowned for his martial excellence, Teclis, who could not hope to match his brother’s physical prowess, instead became a magic-user of no small note. Widely considered to be the most powerful sorcerer of the age and one of the greatest ever to walk the world, there are few, if any, capable of defeating him in a duel, not even the vengeance-obsessed Dark Elf Witch King, Malekith.\\n\\nUnlike his brother, who considers the defence of the High Elf kingdom of Ulthuan his chief duty, Teclis has a care for the whole world and sees it as his duty to prevent it falling into the hands of the Ruinous Powers. It is this generosity of spirit that has seen the High Elves allied with such disparate races as the men of the Empire and the Lizardmen of Lustria, impacting the former to the extent that the Empire’s fabled Colleges of Magic would never have existed if it was not for Teclis’ wise counsel and tuition in magical matters. Such is his renown, Teclis – the Loremaster of Hoeth and Warden of the White Tower – casts a shadow so lengthy that his influence will be felt right across the world long after his death.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_hef_tyrion	"Our beautiful land is besieged on all sides, but we resist like our fathers before us. We will emerge victorious and more intractable than ever to these turbulent times when our corrupt brothers come to ravage our shores. We are the Asur, the sons of Aenarion and Ulthuan shall never fall."\\n\\nThe ancient High Elves have long stood guard over the world, ensuring it remains in balance – Daemonic efforts of hordes of Chaos and the foolish meddling of younger, ‘lesser’ races notwithstanding. Known among their kind as the Asur, the High Elves are both conceited and detached, no doubt due to their immense longevity and the comparative isolation of their island kingdom of Ulthuan, which forces such a worldview to a great extent. Whereas in other races such traits could prove fatal, in the Asur’s case they are assets, for the Elves have used them to attain knowledge and skills in magic and war that far outstrip those of almost all their historical adversaries.\\n\\nNow, there is one among the Asur – a warrior so great that he has yet to meet his match with a blade: Prince Tyrion, Heir of Aenarion and Defender of Ulthuan. So impressive are Tyrion’s martial talents, so perfectly does he combine skill-at-arms with speed of thought, that there are many among the Asur who consider him to be both the world’s greatest living warrior and the reincarnation of the first Phoenix King, Aenarion, said to be reborn and living again through the young prince.\\n\\nUnswervingly loyal to the current Phoenix King, Finubar, and the Everqueen, Alarielle, Tyrion discharges his duty as Ulthuan’s defender with the utmost seriousness, spending much of his time building up and training the High Elves’ armies into a fighting force with few equals, if any. \\n\\nThere are also many entries in the Asur’s Book of Days that stand testament to the prince’s personal bravery – during the cataclysmic Battle of Finuval Plain, against his arch enemy, the Witch King Malekith, and his Dark Elf forces, Prince Tyrion even rescued the Everqueen from the battlefield, and has remained her consort and closest advisor ever since.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_lzd_kroq_gar	"Summon Grymloq. Now we hunt!"\\n\\nTo the south of the world, in much warmer, jungle climes, live the Lizardmen. These reptilian champions of order are not one race but a collective of various cold-blooded creatures all dedicated to bringing the Great Plan of the Old Ones – the stellar race that terraformed the world before the Ancient Enemy brought Ruin – to fruition.\\n\\nThe Lizardmen are led by the Slann Mage-Priests, who in turn are served by the adaptable Skinks, the labouring Kroxigor and the fearsome warrior-caste, the mighty Saurus. It is the Saurus that form the bulk of the Lizardmen armies for they are spawned for that sole purpose – bringing war to those deigned as enemies by the Mage-Priests.\\n\\nJust because the Saurus have no concerns beyond battle does not mean they are limited in intellect. Far from it, in fact, for they excel in the role for which they are specifically spawned. None among their number is more capable or feared by the warmbloods than Kroq-Gar, Last Defender of Xhotl. Kroq-Gar is an Ancient Scar-Leader and a legendary presence amongst the Lizardmen, for he has fought Daemons and countless enemies over untold millennia.\\n\\nUnquestioningly, Kroq-Gar was blessed by the Old Ones during his spawning, for he was among the last survivors of Xhotl, a temple-city that suffered constant Daemonic attack during the Great Cataclysm. After the loss of his home temple-city, he continued to fight; master-less, he and his Saurus Warriors ranged far across the jungles seeking out foes and interlopers, of which there are many.\\n\\nIn recent centuries, Kroq-Gar has fallen under the sway of Lord Mazdamundi. The great second generation Mage-Priest recognised in him an eternal warrior spirit and gifted him the Hand of Gods, a relic of the Old Ones. Strategically positioned for the coming wars, Mazdamundi has sent Kroq-Gar and his loyal cohorts across the World Pond to the Southlands. The Last Defender has been tasked with re-establishing the failing Geomantic Web and bringing about the next stage of the Great Plan: the annihilation of the myriad enemies of order.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_main_political_party_lzd_lord_mazdamundi	"The time of inaction is over. The great purpose must be accomplished."\\n\\nThe Lizardmen are the reptilian guardians of Order. They follow the Great Plan set down by the Old Ones, as interpreted by the Slann Mage-Priests who direct the small and capable Skinks, the Saurus Warriors, bestial Kroxigor and myriad other reptilian servants.\\n\\nBeing cold-blooded, Lizardmen reside in the warmer climates, mainly across the jungle-continent of Lustria and the Southlands. Hidden within the undergrowth are the temple-cities where the Slann contemplate and the other reptilian castes live to serve the Old Ones’ will. Shining brightest of all the ancient temple-cities is Hexoatl, the City of the Sun. Though Itza is the First City, Hexoatl has eclipsed it in importance due to its status as home to Lord Mazdamundi, the most active of all the remaining Slann Mage-Priests. Due to its location and history, the City of the Sun is the most fortified and martial of all the temple-cities. Whereas the boundaries of most other cities simply merge with the jungle, Hexoatl has mighty walls and serried ranks of Saurus patrol its plazas. Until recently, even the Norse trespassers of Skeggi and its surrounding colonies avoided Hexoatl, although that has changed of late.\\n\\nYet it is not just the city and its reptilian legions that enemies and invaders must be wary of, but its mighty leader, Lord Mazdamundi, oldest and most powerful of the living Slann Mage-priests; he who can bring ruination upon cities; he that rides the horned beast.\\n\\nAfter years of contemplation, Mazdamundi has come to a simple epiphany: the Great Plan cannot move to the next phase until the first stage has been completed. This involves relocating a few, select races and the utter obliteration of the fell spawn that infests the world.\\n\\nAnd so, with the fire of Old One, Chotec, burning within Lord Mazdamundi, the time of inaction is over – the Great Plan will be executed – order *will* come from Chaos, no matter the cost!	false

Reject false-words of seers and embrace true face of the Horned One! Bring Skrolk to the Wormstone, and you will be Plague Priest. Betray, and you become pus-bag."\\n\\nUnderneath the world lurks the Skaven - a race of noisome ratmen that despise all other things and desire world domination with every fibre of their twisted beings - from their quivering whiskers to the tips of their segmented tails.\\n\\nClan Pestilens is one of the four Greater Clans. Its members are the Plague Monks – the disciples of disease and decay. Clan Pestilens dedicate themselves with insane fervour to spreading corruption in the name of the Great Horned Rat. Pestilens was the first clan to reach Lustria; there, in the hot, foetid conditions, did the disease-ridden ratmen start to overcome the climate to found Clan Pestilens. It wasn’t long before the emergent clan encountered the Lizardmen and an age-old enmity was born. Of all the warm-blooded invaders to trespass on Lustria, it is the Skaven – and Clan Pestilens in particular – that the Lizardmen hate the most. Eventually, after decades of self-imposed exile, the Plague Monks re-joined the Under-Empire and immediately claimed their place on the Council of Thirteen. Their leader is Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, and while he controls the clan from Skavenblight it is Lord Skrolk that remains in Lustria to return Pestilens to greatness.\\n\\nLord Skrolk is an affront to nature. Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and even the air around him seems to congeal and darken. Skrolk is ancient and blind, but only a fool would mistake his lack of sight for weakness… In battle, Skrolk leads from the front so he can unleash his rabid fury, wielding the Rod of Corruption and reading from the Liber Bubonicus - a tome describing every disease conjured by Pestilens that even the Chaos God, Nurgle, is said to covet. But Skrolk’s greatest asset is and always will be his cunning. This Plague Priest has lived for countless centuries and is far more than a mere frenzied zealot!	false

Queek will show the whole world that Queek is the mightiest, the best, the most deadly! We will see what Gnawdwell says about orders then."\\n\\nThe Skaven are vile, malevolent ratmen that swarm beneath the surface of the world. Hidden in their sprawling underground lairs, they gnaw at the roots of civilisation, plotting and scheming for the day they will burst from their dark tunnels and drown the world above in a tide of mangy fur, rusty blades and plague-ridden filth.\\n\\nThe Skaven Under-Empire consists of countless clans. Each one – just like each individual Skaven – jostles for position, status and power. The four Greater Clans are unassailable in this never-ending race, but under them, the Warlord Clans are a thriving mass of betrayal and broken alliances. Clan Mors is currently the most powerful, their ascendancy in no small part due to their control of the City of Pillars – the lower levels of Karak Eight Peaks and an important nexus of the Under-Empire. While the grand ruler of Clan Mors, Warlord Gnawdwell, takes his seat on the Council of Thirteen in the ratmen capital of Skavenblight, the City of Pillars falls under Gnawdwell’s infamous ‘Right Claw’: Queek Headtaker.\\n\\nThe scarlet-armoured, fur-clad warrior of rage and ego is Queek Headtaker - scion of Clan Mors and one of the most accomplished and fierce fighters in all Skavendom. He is despised by Dwarfs for the sheer amounts of heads he has taken, with a record number of entries in the Great Book of Grudges, but he is also hated by Greenskins and Elves too. The only thing more renowned than Queek’s fighting prowess is his arrogance. The Headtaker is a power-hungry narcissist who carries the severed heads of his latest victims upon his trophy rack, advertising to enemies and followers just how truly great he is.\\n\\nWhile Queek has carved quite the powerbase under Eight Peaks, Gnawdwell sends him wherever Clan Mors needs him to be. The Council of Thirteen - of which Gnawdwell is a part - see Headtaker as a powerful asset to enable their plans, whether Queek agrees with them or not!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh2_twa03_political_party_def_rakarth	Dark Elves are no strangers to war; their heartless credo is that the strong take whatever they wish, and that the weak choke on their own blood. There is no realm that has not suffered the predations of their corsairs or the blood-mad march of Khaine’s worshippers. Every victory against the lesser races of primitive lands strengthens their battle against their hated cousins the High Elves, whether by an influx of fresh slaves, the honing of battle skill, or simply the culling of the weak from Druchii ranks.\\n\\nA cruel and wicked race, the Dark Elves revel in the pain and despair of others and are capable of the most wanton acts of depravity and murder. The means by which they carry out their immoral causes are many-fold, but from Karond Kar come the beasts of war that are trained to serve such twisted desires. The city also known as Slaver’s Gate is where the stolen steeds brought up by the soft Asur are brought to bear by whip and red-hot brand, and where the ferocious Cold Ones are hatched, hand-reared, and forced to accept their cruel masters as riders. For the Druchii have always been experts at bending beasts and animals to their will, though some show exceptional aptitude in this, commanding even the unruliest beasts with a single word. They are the famed Beastmasters.\\n\\nIt is said that Karond Kar’s dungeons are filled with one or more of every monster ever discovered in the known world. Such an impressive distinction, however, is by virtue of the single greatest Beastmaster of Naggaroth and one of Karond Kar’s greatest sons, the Beastlord Rakarth. His exploits throughout the world’s oceans have caused him to be well known and feared by many who reside along the world’s vulnerable coastlines. Those who survive the slave-raids of the Thousand Maws speak of the mighty beasts which tower over Rakarth’s ranks and salivate within his battle lines, for no other Dreadlord of the Druchii goes to war with such a number or range of abominations. With an almost supernatural ability to subdue and control wild creatures, Rakarth is as fell and dangerous a being as any tyrant of Naggaroth, having laid waste to countless towns and ports, from Norsca in the far north to the Bay of Corsairs in the south. It is not for nothing that he is known as Beastlord, as testified by the hordes of roaring, smoke-spouting monsters that bring him glorious, blood-soaked victory time and time again.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc03_political_party_beastmen_malagor	The Beastmen believe that Malagor is the doom of mankind personified. He is a figure of nightmare, revered by the Beastmen but feared, above all, by superstitious men. To the denizens of the Empire, Malagor is the harbinger of disaster and destruction; the very embodiment of their downfall. Vilified by the Cult of Sigmar as the epitome of sin, he is depicted in holy wood carvings and tapestries as the ultimate evil - a figure that all Sigmar-fearing men should fight against or despair.\\n\\nFrom the moment of his birth, it was obvious that Malagor was blessed by the Dark Gods, being possessed of a pair of feathered pinions as black as the night. Though Malagor is a Bray-Shaman he does not give his counsel to any one chieftain. Instead, his whisperings steer the course of the entire Beastmen race, visiting the herdstones and shrines across the Great Forest or even venturing deep beyond his normal bounds to cavort in long-devastated civilisations.\\n\\nWhen the Beastmen rise and invade the lands of men with Malagor at its head, buildings will be destroyed and temples torn down or put to flame. Malagor desires nothing less than to cast down gods and goddesses of all kinds, to defile their altars, slay their priests - for he represents the Beastmen's ultimate goal: utter ruin for the Uncloven Ones.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc03_political_party_beastmen_morghur	The Beastmen revere Morghur, for he is the embodiment of disorder and mutation. As he walks, worms and insects fester to the surface, rivers travel the wrong way, and fire flits through the air. The Bray-Shamans claim that if the physical body of Morghur is cut down, then his vile spirit is simply reborn elsewhere. To the Gors, he is the essence of Chaos - the collective will of all Beastmen to fight order and burn civilisation to the ground. While the Beastmen venerate this twisted creature, the Uncloven revile him. The only one to perhaps understand the true horror of Morghur is Queen Ariel of the Wood Elves. It is she alone who perceives what the Shadowgave actually represents: a spirit of evil too powerful to be contained within a single corporeal form. Thus war rages between the Asrai and the Beastmen as the Queen seeks a way to destroy Morghur forever. The Master of Skulls knows of this endeavour but is not concerned, yet hates the Wood Elves for all they represent in turn. And as they seek his destruction, Morghur dedicates all his demented thoughts to devising their ruin.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc03_political_party_beastmen_ruler	Khazrak is a cunning foe. More than a mere brutal Beastlord, he is bestowed with an intellect far superior to that of his peers. The One-Eye has a deep understanding of his followers, able to channel the unruly nature of the herd and corral his Gors by harnessing their wild nature. Not every true-horn is worthy of Khazrak's retinue; inferior tribes will come, Gors from across the Drakwald, drawn by the One-Eye's dark reputation and hoping to share in his despicable spoils. But Khazrak's success means he can afford to be choosy, and so only those Cloven Ones he deems worthy are offered a place by his side. Those that are turned down may well be sent on their way unmolested, others that Khazrak deems as a threat - perhaps bitter at their rejection - will not leave the immediate area alive. With the One-Eye able to be selective, Khazrak retains a fearsome grip upon his army - a wild force that enacts his cunning and effective plans with murderous efficiency. No one is spared during Khazrak's attacks, his superbly-trained Warhounds easily chasing down the few who manage to escape the warherd's trap.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc04_political_party_empire_volkmar	Volkmar the Grim is both leader and spiritual head of the Cult of Sigmar. He is a pious and foreboding man dedicated to the destruction of evil, whether it takes the form of Chaos or the rotting darkness of Unlife. He is no cleric hiding away from what he decries, nor a priest more content with the wealth and status such a position brings - an accusation that has been justifiably levied at Grand Theogonists in the past. Sigmar was a warrior in life and a god to fighters upon his ascension, so His clergy follow their Lord’s example - none more so than Volkmar the Grim. He has fought in countless battles, both on and off the War Altar of Sigmar - a mobile shrine of divine power. When Volkmar fights, the men of the Empire are encouraged by the sight that Sigmar’s holy representative smiting His foes in their midst.\\n\\nAs well as a warrior and pious Cult leader, Volkmar is a strong ally of Karl Franz. In fact it was their alliance that gave Franz the three votes he needed to beat Boris Todbringer’s candidacy, thus suggesting that amidst the fire and wrath there is a shrewdness to Volkmar - something that many in the courts of Altdorf and Middenheim do not give him credit for. However, this has agitated relations between the Cult of Sigmar and Middenland, especially with the Ar-Ulric, the religious leader of Ulric’s cult. Hence, there is a need for a strong Emperor on the throne, someone with a powerful congregation of Sigmar’s chosen at his side.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc04_political_party_vampire_helman	Originally the youngest of five strong brothers from Templehof, Ghorst was a farrier and groom just like his father. His love of danger and the open road meant he would make any excuse to deliver messages to Ulfheim or Vassel. One day, he returned from his adventures to find his brothers and father dead in their beds, taken by the ravaging Plague of Blue Roses. Fungus-bruises covered their bodies, and its spores were thick in the air. Ghorst could not accept their loss. At first he tried to embrace his lost brothers, but the plague would not take him - fate had other designs for Helman Ghorst! Eventually he plunged himself into the study of the black arts, hoping to return his brothers to life.\\n\\nFrom that moment on, Ghorst was far from the good-natured farrier’s son, instead being marked for a much darker destiny. In studying the black arts, he lost himself to forbidden lore and communed with dread things. Driven by far more than the lust for power, but a deep personal grief, he went further than many other Necromancer had previously dared. Such ambition, combined with a wilful lack of self-preservation for his own soul, drew the attention of Mannfred von Carstein, another driven by familial bonds, though ones far different in nature. In Ghorst, Mannfred found a willing puppet, a servant whose loyalty he could easily buy; in Mannfred, Ghorst saw a master of Necromantic lore, who could bring his brothers back to full Unlife, if he himself proved worthy.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc05_political_party_wood_elves_durthu	Once, Durthu was benevolent. It was he, the eldest of the Treeman Ancients that first bound the spirits of the forest with the Children of Isha. For many seasons, the alliance was considered a good thing; the forest flourished and the Worldroots seeped deep underneath the land. Then, he bore witness to the rapacity of blooded life. He saw untold acres of trees felled and the Elves themselves invite countless calamities not only on their race, but on the greater forest realms as well. Now Durthu's patience has gone, replaced by anger and madness. Once a healer, now he is wrathful, making no distinction between the lost, the innocent and the wicked. The Elves are spared the Ancient's anger… for now at least, but he no longer considers them friends, only allies for common cause. And yet there are many foes wishing to trespass under the boughs of Athel Loren, forcing the ancient Treeman to fight with the Asrai, who respect Durthu still, even if he no longer cares for them.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc05_political_party_wood_elves_ruler	Orion is the god-king of the Wood Elves, a powerful being who dies each Midwinter upon a pyre only to be born again in Spring. A savage King, he is the vessel of the Elven God, Kurnous, the Hunter. However, Orion's savagery is tempered with the wisdom of Queen Ariel's guidance and that of the countless hosts who choose to take his form each year. Every vernal equinox, a young prince is taken to the Oak of Ages and there fashioned by the Elven Queen into the King's mighty form. With each year that passes, another chosen one is called and another voice added to the choir of personalities that influence Orion. The eldest are now the faintest of whispers, having lived as the King thousands of years hence, while the most recent add their youthful fury to the god-King's will. And yet the 'King in the Wood' persists, continuing to reign throughout the many seasons of his existence. In battle, when his realm is threatened, Orion is the first to fight in its defence. Taking up his mighty weapons of war, he winds his great horn and calls the Elves of Athel Loren to the Wild Hunt!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc06_political_party_belegar_ruler	Karak Eight Peaks was once a Greathold, second only to the majesty and strength of Everpeak in the Karaz Ankor. It was ruled by Clan Angrund, whose Royal line can trace its Ancestry back to Grungni and Valaya, which makes the loss of Eight Peaks the most bitter of grudges for all Dwarfs. None feel it more so than the descendants of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to sit on its throne. \\n\\nSince the fall of Karak Eight Peaks, Clan Angrund has scattered across the Karaz Ankor but retained significant sway simply because of its legacy. When Belegar Ironhammer, descended from King Lunn, rose to power he made great oaths - that he would not rest until the lost Hold had been reclaimed and he, its rightful heir, sat upon its throne. The High King, Thorgrim Grudgebearer, was initially sceptical – Ironhammer’s expedition would not be the first to attempt such a feat. Karak Eight Peaks has notoriously been riddled with foes of all kinds ever since its fall. Currently, a particularly sneaky and cunning Night Goblin 'Warlord' rules the upper levels of Eight Peaks, one who has easily thwarted such quests in the past.\\n\\nYet two things work to Belegar's advantage. Skarsnik has problems of his own right now - problems of the mutinous kind - and Belegar has a will of iron, as a great leader who excels at subterranean warfare. It should be noted, though, that this is his fourth attempt to recapture his Ancestral fortress, to the great shame of all Dawi, living or dead. However, the Ironhammer will not easily be stopped. Finally, after decades spent fostering the support of Guilds and allies, and with the full support of the High King, Belegar gathers Clan Angrund at Karak Izor. Once more a throng of vengeful Dwarfs will set off under Ironhammer’s command, to claim what is rightfully theirs!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc06_political_party_skarsnik_ruler	Throughout all of history, very few Goblins have risen to the top of the Greenskin food chain. Skarsnik is one of them. He is a Night Goblin whose supreme cunning and malign intellect far surpasses that of his peers. It is this gift, and the presence of his incredibly loyal and eternally-hungry Cave Squig, Gobbla, that has allowed him to climb the brutal hierarchy of the Crooked Moon tribe and remain at the top. Orcs typically struggle to take orders or be subservient to Goblins. Naturally, a few have tried to usurp Skarsnik, but needless to say that Gobbla ate especially well on such occasions - the sneaky Night Goblin’s cunning far outweighing an Orc’s brutal and direct challenge.\\n\\nWhilst Skarsnik has retained an iron grip on his tribe, his real achievement (the one for which he is hated by both Dwarfs and Skaven alike) is his domination of Karak Eight Peaks, the former Dwarf mountain fortress. The self-proclaimed 'Warlord of the Eight Peaks' has controlled the surface for years, something which has enraged the stunties beyond forbearance!\\n\\nProvoking the Dwarfs, or any of the Warlord’s many enemies, is what Skarsnik does best. A master of deception, he captures his foes and uses their tortured screams or body parts (scalped beards for stunties) to bait his ever-more devious traps. His targets almost always take the lure, as they are simply not used to Greenskins having such an intricate take on warfare. However, as Skarsnik’s evil reputation continues to grow, fewer adversaries dare underestimate him. Truly, the Warlord of the Eight Peaks is one to be feared!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc06_political_party_wurrzag_ruler	Ever since Wurrzag Ud Ura Zahubu dragged the Bone Nose tribe up to greatness - after accidently turning their original Shaman into a Squiggly Beast - he has claimed to speak directly for Gork and Mork, da Great Green Godz. The Savage Orc Shaman has crossed the Southlands and headed deep into the Badlands, joining tribes and rekindling the spark of the Waaagh! in them that they may have lost. His words and presence can lift a tribe to greater things in the name of Gork (or perhaps Mork). In the Land of the Dead, Wurrzag joined the Spotted Skullz tribe, leading them to victory against the Undead legions and their animated statuary. There are many other examples of Wurrzag's interventions, and so his reputation has spread far and wide.\\n\\nAmong most tribes, his arrival is seen as a blessing that Mork (or Gork, maybe) has chosen them for some special mission. Not all Warbosses are so welcoming, however. Some view Wurrzag with suspicion, reckoning he comes always on the eve of events set in motion already, taking the credit even though it was the Bosses that did all the zoggin’ work in the first place! They argue that a Waaagh! can happen and countless do without Wurrzag present to trigger them. Whatever the truth, Wurrzag certainly believes he was put on this mortal plane as a tool of the Green Godz, and when Orcs believe something, then fate has a habit of making it true...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc07_political_party_bretonnia_alberic	Bordeleaux is one of the founding dukedoms of Bretonnia, occupying the western coastal region just south of cursed Mousillon. The current duke is the courageous yet stern Alberic, known for his strict adherence to the rules of chivalry and the preservation of the natural order. Knights trained under Alberic are among the very best Bretonnia has to offer, showing almost suicidal levels of bravery on the battlefield – never shrinking from an opponent, no matter their size or reputation. Duke Alberic’s coat of arms bears the distinctive Trident of Manann, the Sea God, who watches over Bordeleaux’s coastlines and vies with the Lady of the Lake for the affections of its people, such is his importance in the region. Certainly, along the sea routes and among sea-borne traders, Manann is considered the more popular patron-god. Legend has it that Alberic’s ancestor, Duke Marcus – one of the original Companions of Gilles the Uniter – himself fought alongside the temperamental sea god; apparently, the pair expelled raiders from Bordeleaux’s coastlines together, restoring peace and allowing trade to flourish once again unhindered.\\n\\nDuke Alberic's bravery and strict self-discipline is well known, and naturally he expects his Knights to reach the same high personal standards, even going so far to dismiss and expel those who err or fail to meet them. This means that Alberic has the smallest Ducal household in the Kingdom, but one that is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and containing some of Bretonnia’s greatest Knights. Unfortunately, circumstance has thus far prevented Alberic from achieving his life’s ambition – to embark upon a Grail Quest. For this to happen, a suitable successor must be found so that Bordeleaux may continue to flourish in his absence. Despite his advancing years, the Duke remains hopeful that a candidate may yet emerge, enabling him to leave his ancestral seat and search for the holy chalice of legend in the Lady’s blessed name!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc07_political_party_bretonnia_fay	The Lady of the Lake is the principle Bretonnian deity, said to embody the pure, noble, courageous spirit for which the kingdom is known. Her earthly representative is the Fay Enchantress, who watches over Bretonnia from her tower in Carcassonne and upon whose wise counsel King Louen depends. In fact, during times of dynastic crisis, the Enchantress is empowered to choose the next Royarch from amongst the dukes and has, on at least one prior occasion, stripped a tyrannical or cruel ruler of his throne and commanded his own Knights to forcibly expel the oppressor from the Kingdom! Whilst undoubtedly ancient – some say thousands of years old even – the Enchantress appears to all as a beautiful young woman and is reincarnated instantly as soon as her host body wears out. Although undoubtedly a fearsome sorceress more than capable of defeating her enemies by herself, the Fay Enchantress is served by her loyal body of Grail Knights, whose lives are sworn to protect her person and obey any and all commands. She is also served by the Damsels and Prophetesses of the Lady, who are called into her service as children and become her acolytes, eventually having not insignificant magical powers of their own.\\n\\nThe Enchantress is the one who rouses the usually competitive Dukedoms of Bretonnia into united action when the kingdom is threatened by evil forces from without. It has even been known, at times of mortal peril, for her to ride into battle ahead of an army of her fiercely-loyal Grail Knights. On the battlefield, she uses magic to both protect Bretonnian forces from attack or weaken and strike down the foe – sometimes with a single, furious stare!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc07_political_party_bretonnia_ruler	King Louen Leoncoeur – ‘the Lionhearted’ – is the current King of Bretonnia, having ascended to the throne following a unanimous vote of his peers and with the consent of the Fay Enchantress, the earthly representative of the blessed Lady of the Lake. It is this approval that means the most to Louen, for in years past he completed a Grail Quest, expelling evil from Bretonnian lands before supping from the mystical chalice and receiving the Lady’s blessing. From his capital at Couronne, the King rules wisely and with an even-hand when dealing with Knight or noble alike. Fairness in all matters is his watchword, never allowing the law as written to compromise its noble intent, never refusing anyone – peasants excepted of course – a hearing in his presence to air grievances of which he must be the judge. So great is Louen’s statecraft and mastery of diplomacy that many consider him to be not just the natural successor of Gilles the Uniter, but believe he is descended from the same noble bloodline.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, Louen is a deadly adversary, a natural general, and the Lady’s chosen champion – leading the Knights of Bretonnia into the fray upon his noble Hippogryph, Beaquis, and smiting evil wherever he finds it. Somehow, the King has halted the aging process, appearing to be a much younger man than his birth records belie; maybe it is the Lady’s favour, her eternal blessings – or even her ethereal kiss – that enables Louen to hold back the advancing years and continue to lead his kingdom to glory? For glory is at hand – the time has come for Bretonnians to rally under King Louen’s banner and, with the blessing of the Lady and the protection of the Fay Enchantress, march on dark, corrupted Mousillon and bring it back under control once and for all!	false

He roams land and sea, a monumental figure encased in black steel armour adorned with the skulls of his many kills. He lives to fight, and makes offerings of his defeated enemies, dedicating their deaths to the Dark Gods he serves.\\n\\nTo aid in his cursed quest, he took the magical longship, Seafang, from the Chaos Sorceress Baga Yar. Powered by blood and driven by daemons, Seafang can travel through any Realm, even harnessing the Winds of Magic themselves. In search of new foes to fight Wulfrik has journeyed from the deserts of the Tomb Kings to the holds of the Dwarfen Lords and the isle of the High Elves. This executioner of the Gods has killed Dragons and Kings, Undead Lords and Chaos-warped Trolls, all in the cause of appeasing the Ruinous Powers. None may refuse the challenge he delivers in their own tongue, and once he has fixed on a foe, that foe will not escape him.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_dlc08_political_party_norsca_throgg	King Throgg is a most unusual Troll. His race is famed for their fierce ways and brutish strength and for a corresponding lack of intelligence but whilst Throgg may be a vicious brute, he is no idiot. In the bone-strewn wastes of Troll Country, at the heart of his icy labyrinth, he sits and thinks, brooding alone on his rocky throne, the filth-encrusted crown ringing one of his yellowed tusks a once-priceless heirloom taken from a great warrior whose noble quest led him only to Throgg's gullet.\\n\\nOnce, Throgg was happy with a life of hunting and killing. He led his monstrous kin in successful raids, ambushes and night attacks, using the harsh climate of the north as an ally; to a Troll like Throgg, a brutal ice-shard blizzard is no more troubling than a light summer rain. Throgg became known to the warriors of the Old World as Wintertooth, a fearsome and mindless adversary. \\n\\nYet the mutations Throgg and his kin welcome can affect the mind too. One moonless night, as Throgg picked the flesh of his latest victim from his tusks, he stopped to consider the broken bodies of his prey. He began to think. As Throgg muttered to himself through the following days, his eyes burning with cold fire, a grim and malevolent cunning grew within him. If Man and the other races of the so-called civilised lands of the south were so keen to fight him and his bestial subjects, then fight them he would. He would gather a nightmarish horde of Chaos-infested creatures and overrun the lands of man in the name of the Dark Gods!	false

Jagged ridges are silhouetted like the broken teeth of some titanic beast as lightning flashes and thunder roars. Before a great chasm that splits the mountains like a gigantic axe wound, hundreds upon hundreds of Northmen kneel in the pelting hail and snow, chanting sonorously as their captives are sacrificed and hurled bodily into a cavernous lair. Then, as the storm reaches its terrible climax, a terror from prehistory bursts forth with a roar that shakes the roots of the peaks themselves – Kholek Suneater awakes, and all the world trembles at his wrath.	false

The Priest uncovered a set of heretical manuscripts transcribed by one of the acolytes of the infamous Necrodomo the Insane, a prophet who tore out his own eyes after having a vision of the destruction of the world at the hands of Chaos.\\n\\nWhat Archaon learned from these texts is unknown, but legend has it that he uncovered a terrible truth which drove him into a screaming rage. Rejecting the gods of the Empire, he burned down the temple around him and raged amongst the flames. He renounced his own name and swore he would not only give himself body and soul to Chaos, but also forge a new life as the scourge of the deluded fools who worship the Empire’s false gods.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_dwarf_grombrindal	For as long as there has been the Karaz Ankor, there has been the White Dwarf. Grombrindal is an enigmatic figure, recorded throughout the Dwarfs' history, appearing to give aid to his bearded kin whenever their situation becomes especially dire. However, what can one Dwarf do when a Karak is besieged by thousands of Greenskins, or a Dwarf throng surrounded and outnumbered by a warherd of braying, ravenous Beastmen? In Grombrindal’s case, turns out he can do quite a lot; the White Dwarf is a mighty warrior, some say bettered only by Grimnir himself. Every slash of his legendary axe sees the heads of urks tumble from their dishonourable shoulders. Grombrindal has faced armies of thousands on his own and won, which is why many believe him to be a living Ancestor.\\n\\nAccording to the bards he was - and maybe still is - the lover of the venerated hearth goddess Valaya. Grombrindal himself is never drawn on such a vulgar subject, even when the beer starts to flow during the inevitable post-battle feasts. This matters little to most Dwarfs, who are just grateful to have fought beside such a legend and lived to tell of his deeds and achievements on the battlefield. Long before most other Dwarfs have sobered, the White Dwarf dons his hooded cloak and wanders away into the night - for there are always more Dawi to aid, more urks to slay!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_dwarf_ruler	Thorgrim Grudgebearer is the current High King of the Dwarfs. He is a throwback to the High Kings of old - eager for new conquests, mighty in battle, and a merciless enemy. Yet upon his worn brow, there also sits great wisdom, and he is able to uphold the ancient traditions as well as to accept (if not embrace) needed changes, such as alliances and new technology. Thorgrim is forever brooding upon how to return his people to their former glory. As the ultimate ruler of the Dwarfs, the Great Book of Grudges is entrusted into his keeping. It is Thorgrim’s avowed wish to avenge every single entry contained in that voluminous tome. Such is his resolve that he has already rejuvenated the Karaz Ankor. Tales of his deeds, and the long list of grudges already struck out, fill his grim warriors with the feeling that the Dwarfs have long done without: hope. A new age of retribution has begun.	false

Many years ago, King Barador, Ungrim’s five-time great-grandsire, suffered a terrible loss which drove him to take the Oath of the Slayers to forevermore seek death in battle at the hands of the most deadly enemy they can find. He was torn between conflicting vows: the Slayer Oath to seek out death and the oath of a King to protect his people. His son inherited his vows and continued the line of Slayer Kings, of which King Ungrim Ironfist is but the latest.\\n\\nAlthough Ungrim cannot seek his death in the Slayer fashion, he grows ever more restless, leading the throng of Karak Kadrin into countless battles. Inspired by his High King and seeking to avenge the death of his lone son who was slain, Ungrim will march to war with the least provocation.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_empire_balthasar	Balthasar Gelt came to Altdorf from the city of Marienburg, having bought passage on a merchant ship with gold that he had transmuted from lead ingots. He left the seaport for the Colleges of Magic before the effects wore off, and now rumours abound that the swindled sea captain has placed a rich bounty on Balthasar’s head – though few would dare attempt to collect it.\\n\\nThe transmutation of common artefacts into precious metal has always fascinated Balthasar. Driven by his obsession, he spent many years combining his knowledge of alchemy, learnt in far-off lands, with the magical Lore of Metal. Balthasar’s fierce intelligence lent him a greater understanding of this branch of magic than any of his fellow students or tutors, and he rose quickly through the ranks of the Gold Order. Within a mere decade, Balthasar had become the Patriarch of the Golden College, the youngest wizard to ever hold the title.\\n\\nBalthasar’s research into new formulations of black powder even made him popular with the Imperial Engineers School, an organisation that often dismisses magic as superstitious nonsense. However, during these studies, a freak explosion almost ended Balthasar’s quest for knowledge forever. Somehow he survived, and from that day on he has only ever been seen swathed in shimmering, metallic robes and wearing a golden face mask. Some say that beneath his mask his skin has turned to pure gold, while others whisper that he is horribly disfigured, though the truth of the matter is known only to Balthasar. One thing is certain: the accident only furthered his will to succeed, and this determination increased his powers to new heights. With a single gesture, Balthasar Gelt can transform his enemies into lifeless golden statues or turn their bones into molten iron. With such power at his command, Balthasar has secured victory for the Empire on numerous occasions.	false

The Emperor frequently takes personal command of his soldiers, like Sigmar, the Warrior-God of old, smiting enemies of the Empire with every blow.\\n\\nThere is little doubt that Karl Franz is one of the greatest generals of his age.

All Orcs must fight to survive, but the tribes that dwell in Troll Country must endure particularly rigorous challenges. Monsters and packs of trolls stalk that deadly land, while Chaos warbands raid from the North. There is no safety amongst Orc kind, as the different tribes of Troll Country are bitter rivals, eager to destroy each other whenever they meet. Such are the lands in which Azhag rose to prominence.\\n\\nHaving established dominance over all competitors, he took control of his own mob and his exploits brought Greenskins flocking to his banner. Amongst these new followers were Shamans, both Goblin and Orc, and many of these have spoken of the strange and portentous aura that surrounds Azhag. Several have been visited with green-tinged visions in which Azhag sits astride a mighty Wyvern, an ominous iron crown on his brow from which an insistent voice whispers and mighty spells of Death emanate. If the Shamans are to be believed, Azhag has a mighty and terrible future ahead of him.	false

They were tired and hungry, but were Black Orcs nonetheless, and particularly hard ones at that. Even for a Black Orc, Grimgor’s thirst for war was exceptional. If a single day went by without a battle, Grimgor was known to start camp-decimating arguments, his one good eye blazing with eagerness to find fault and start a good scrap. Two days without a battle and Grimgor would smite anything he could reach, save (perhaps) his fellow Black Orcs. Who knows what would happen if three days without a battle ever occurred? Even scarred veterans tremble just to think of it. This unquenchable thirst for battle is a sign that marks out a Warboss for leadership, a sign that the Orc is favoured by Gork. In a hulking Black Orc with unmatched fighting skills and ferocity, it has marked out Grimgor for greatness; the prophet and harbinger of Gork.	false

Freed from the shackles and illusion of subservience to the von Carsteins, the Necromancer now prowls his old wanderings in the Grey Mountains, which straddle the border between the Empire and Bretonnia - sworn enemies who have moved against him in the past. But Kemmler has always coverted power beyond anything else, and this time the Forces of Order will not stop him - the dead will rise and the world will fall!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_main_political_party_vampire_ruler	Before rising to his current power, Mannfred von Carstein avoided the infighting of his peers and instead travelled far and wide, seeking to deepen his knowledge of Necromantic lore. He made unholy pilgrimages to ancient tombs and cities, where he wrested forbidden secrets from bone-dry scrolls made from human skin, studied ancient spells in the first of the Books of the Dead and struck foul bargains with powerful long-dead beings.\\n\\nWhen Mannfred finally returned to Sylvania, he was more powerful than ever, and he took over the Undead legions in the wake of his insane predecessor’s destruction. Though previously he had travelled in the guise of an Imperial lord, now at the height of his power his appearance has become more horrifying – his face became contorted and corpse-like, and his scalp writhing with magical energy. Yet his new-found powers are not enough, and he thirsts for evermore as part of his designs for the Imperial throne.	false

Already narcissistic, prideful, and immoral in the extreme, the heir to Sylvania’s throne was, in so many ways, an ideal candidate for the Blood Kiss. To any other suitor, they would have been abhorrent, deal-breaking qualities, but not so Vlad von Carstein.\\n\\nFor Isabella, the marriage was at first purely one of convenience, but as the months passed her natural resistance to his charms caused Vlad to fall deeply in love with his pale bride and she for him. Although he tried to resist her requests to taste the Blood Kiss, to be made Unliving, the terrible, wasting disease that threatened to kill his coldly-beautiful new wife forced his hand. Realising that he could not continue without her, Vlad gave the dying Isabella what she desired and inducted her into the Midnight Aristocracy’s nefarious ranks.\\n\\nEver since then, the pair have been together – Isabella standing proudly by Vlad’s side, nourishing his lust for power and dominion over the Empire and beyond. On the field of battle, when fighting alongside her husband, she is strengthened by his presence and he by hers. Oft-times, Isabella von Carstein carries the Blood Chalice of Bathori before her, a goblet of gold that belonged to her bloodthirsty ancestor, brimming with fresh blood at all times. She sups it constantly, even in the cut and thrust of the fray – the blood healing her wounds almost instantly and confounding her opponents just long enough for the killing blow to be struck!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_wh_pro02_political_party_vlad_ruler	The first and greatest of the Vampire Counts was Vlad von Carstein. Some say before his appearance in Sylvania over 700 years ago, he was in the Lahmian court at the time of Neferata’s ascendancy to immortality. Others believe him to be a dispossessed Empire noble who stumbled into Undeath but refused the damnation fate had placed upon him. Instead of withering, he set in motion events that would see the Vampire Counts - and the von Carstein name - challenge the greatest nation of men in the world.\\n\\nVlad was not the first Vampire encountered by the Empire, but before his rise to power these Undead creatures had been solitary predators. A few had perhaps amassed small forces and carved out far-flung domains, but it was Vlad’s usurpation of Sylvania and legitimate gaining of the title of Count that marked a new era of bloodshed. When he revealed his true intentions to the rest of the Empire, two hundred years after his arrival in that cursed region, he waged war in order to become Emperor - for he truly believed he had a legitimate claim to the throne. It has since become a burning desire of all his bloodline, who feel - righteously or not - that they should become Emperor, for is it not right that the farmer herds the cattle? Vlad has been thwarted in his quest on a few occasions, but has always managed to find a way back to Unlife. Now he has risen yet again – and his desire to conquer the mortal fools is as strong as ever!	false
