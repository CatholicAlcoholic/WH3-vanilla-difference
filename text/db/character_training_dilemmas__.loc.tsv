character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_envoy_of_ice	A Maiden of the Ice Court is an envoy of the Tzarina, sent across the realm to serve Katarin's interests.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_guardians_of_the_ice	The Tzarina is served and protected by the formidable warrior women of the Ice Guard.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_ice_fightress	Ice Maidens are dedicated attendants of the Tzarina, but also bourgeoning Sorceresses in the arcane lores of the Motherland.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_iron_maiden	Ice Maidens are chosen in part for their steely will – a common trait in all Kislevites – but even more expected in the Tzarina's attendants. Others strengthen their bond with the Motherland by stalking across its tundra.	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_manifest_power	As well as battle magic, some Ice Maidens are granted permission to learn formidable elemental powers that have only manifested during the time the Ice Queen has reigned.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_not_yet_accomplished	Ice Maidens are attendants to the Tzarina, not yet as accomplished as the more powerful Ice Witches.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_provincial_matters	Being part of the Ice Court rarely means a Maiden stays solely within the Bokha Palace. They are envoys, travelling the Oblasts and beyond, using their glacial arts in the regions for the benefit of the nation. In this instance, how should the Maiden exert her influence?	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_selfless_defence	Should the need to defend arise, be it herself or loyal Kislevian troops, the Ice Maiden will not shirk from such duty and shall bring her powers and wisdom to bear.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_the_frost_moons_boon	The Frost Moon is when Mannslieb rises high above its evil twin.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_frost_maiden_the_path_once_taken	The Maiden, a young neophyte of the Ice Court, must now choose the path that best serves our queen. Should she walk in the storm or through the blizzard?	false

With the Frost Moon high should it be fleet-hooved cavalry or steadfast infantry that receive this gift?	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_disciplined_approach	Having served the Ice Court for decades, it is time the Witch dedicated herself to one of the disciplines practised within winter's halls. Choose – storm or snow?	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_fight_fire_with_ice	While all Witches of the Ice Court are exceptional Mages, there are those who also excel at the martial combat practiced by the Ice Guard, while others focus solely on their arcane talents to become the best sorceresses!	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_fight_or_build	An Ice Witch has many roles outside the Ice Court, respected by Druzhina and other nobles when in their presence to advise on civic matters, or even lend their power to battle should the need arise.	false

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_ice_raider	Those who stoke the wrath of an Ice Witch will not merely have their hearts frozen inside their bodies, but their possessions shall become part of Kislev's treasury. The Witch should decide from where this toll is collected.	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_icy_discipline	Betterment is a tenet of those that serve in the Ice Court. Even one as accomplished as a Witch is expected to continue and improve. Which area should she focus on next?	false

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_mothers_army	The Ice Witch is sought to make an important strategic decision.

character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_summon_the_ice	While Tzarina Katarin is the undisputed mistress of Ice Lore, the Ice Witches are second only to their queen in wielding this elemental magic, so which of the mighty powers should this witch focus on?	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_the_visit	The Ice Court sends its envoys to barracks and lodges of the Kislevian armies. A great respect is placed on such a visitation, as they look to the Ice Witch for guidance.	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_tzarinas_favour	The Great Orthodoxy holds influence right across Kislev. Even in the Ice Court, its touch is felt and its agenda considered. The Ice Witch must decide who should receive the sovereign's favour: one of her own Frost Maidens, or a Patriarch to appease the Orthodoxy.	false
character_training_dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_main_character_training_dilemma_ice_witch_will_or_wild	Many Ice Witches are stern women with an iron, unbreakable will tempered by the cold.
