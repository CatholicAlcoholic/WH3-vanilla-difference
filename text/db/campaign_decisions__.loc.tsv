campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_blood_money	War and the gold required to fight it; it is this which dominates oblast communities and provides the stark choice an Ataman must face. Should income be invested, to make all in the community richer, or should warriors be paid to fight and defend the Motherland?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_innovate_or_die	A crucial decision is asked of the Ataman. Should valuable resources be used to shore up the province or spent focusing on innovations and research?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_judgement	Oft times, an Ataman must act as a justice – determining guilt and metering out punishment as required, as well as settling other disputes, legal or otherwise. Such a judgement is now required. Should one be compensated at the expense of the town?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_kislev_still_needs_you	Where should effort and resources be channelled? The Ataman must make a tough decision to reinforce the defences or quickly recruit and grow his local forces.	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_kislevian_coin	Appropriating funds and channelling them for the benefit of their charges is a sworn duty of the Atamans. Should the funds go toward investments or to better bolster the defences against insurrection and overt enemies?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_labour_shortage	There are only so many of Kislev's sons and daughters available, and the needs of the town put strain on the labour. The Ataman must therefore decide whether it is construction or recruitment that is his priority.	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_loyalties_proven	Tensions between the Tzarina's agents and the Great Orthodoxy increase, spilling further out from the capital and into the oblasts. The Ataman is called upon by the factions to prove his loyalty once more.	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_loyalties_revealed	In Kislev city there is said to be a power struggle between the suffocating Great Orthodoxy and the emergent influence of the Ice Court, led by the Tzarina. Now a Patriarch of the Orthodoxy approaches, as does a Frost Maiden, agent of the Ice Queen. To whom should the Ataman show favour?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_seeking_refuge	The folk of Kislev can be generous and welcoming hosts, especially if the guest is willing to drink with them. And yet… there are those who are greeted with suspicion, to whom strong drinks are not offered and about whom whispers of Dark Worship spread. How should the Ataman act as refugees approach?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_the_black_glove	By tradition, once the Black Glove has been delivered from Erengrad, an Ataman must immediately muster the tribes, for war is inevitable. However, his advisors suggest going against the custom on this occasion and exerting more influence across the province.	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_the_hunt	It is considered a mark of great fortune for the Ataman to lead the settlement's hunters in a procession through the streets at the start of the season. Yet, the hunters are factionalised between the trappers, who shun horse, and the archers who chase down prey on their beloved steeds. Which side should the Ataman endorse?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_time_of_dazh	It is the Time of Dazh, where the Ataman must think of home in reverence to the God of Fire and Sun. However, the desire to wander far from the hearth must also be considered. Should the Ataman shrug off his ceremonial role and risk resentment in his own community?	false
campaign_decisions_localised_description_wh3_main_campaign_decision_ataman_within_or_without	Resources are always finite. The Ataman must make a choice whether to address rumours and root out the taint of the Dark Gods, or to ensure the oblasts are patrolled to protect them from more overt threats.	false
