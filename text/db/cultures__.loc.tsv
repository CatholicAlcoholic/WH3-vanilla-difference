cultures_frontend_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_tomb_kings	Nehekhara once stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and human achievement. But this great realm was destroyed through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew.\\n\\nEven as their ancient civilisation now lies buried beneath the sand, the Tomb Kings have once more awoken from their deep sleep. Rising from their sarcophagi, the mummified rulers of Nehekhara have returned to reclaim that which is rightfully theirs, their legions innumerable, brandishing weapons of polished bronze and priceless gold. Ancient, emotionless and spiteful to all those who have slighted them, woe betide those foolish enough to stand before their silent onslaught.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_vampire_coast	The origins of the Undead pirates said to ravage the coasts of Lustria are steeped in mystery. Legend has it that a Norscan longship took on a precious cargo during a raid – an ancient coffin containing, unbeknownst to the crew, the Vampire Luthor Harkon. When the vessel floundered off the Volcanic Islands, the drowned crew were raised as zombies through the Vampire's Dark Magic.\\n\\nThe stretch of coastline known as the Vampire Coast has become infamous amongst seafarers, with countless ships wrecked and raised up from the depths to bolster the fleets of the Unliving. Luthor was but the first. In the years since, more Undead pirates ply the seas for bounty and fresh crews.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh2_main_def_dark_elves	The Dark Elves – or the Druchii, in their own tongue – are one of the most ancient, powerful, and certainly the most sadistic of the three Elven civilisations. The Druchii are raiders, slavers and heartless reavers of the first degree, their every whim being nothing more than to sow misery and pain to all who oppose them, for cruelty is the very lifeblood of their existence. Thus do their Black Arks and Corsair Fleets ply the great waters of the world, raiding and enslaving all before them as a tribute to their own avaricious desires.\\n\\nYet they reserve their most precious hatred for the Elves of Ulthuan, their brethren in ancient times who refused to follow them under the Witch King's reign. Until the High Elves are sundered from Ulthuan, the Dark Elves will continue to bring woe and destruction to all the shores of the world.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh2_main_hef_high_elves	The High Elves – or the Asur, as they call themselves – are one of the most ancient and powerful civilisations of the Old World. Hailing from a mighty, mist-shrouded island-continent located at the centre of the Great Ocean, the High Elves of Ulthuan are a proud and mighty kingdom of masterful warriors, peerless mages and lords of sky and sea. At the zenith of their power, the world was truly theirs for the taking, but in their arrogance they brought about a bloody war against the Dwarfs which crippled both of these two elder races.\\n\\nThe time of the High Elves has passed, yet such is their immense pride that they fight on regardless, for they consider themselves the true and rightful protectors of the known world. Let the servants of destruction beware the Asur's righteous wrath!	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh2_main_lzd_lizardmen	The Lizardmen are an ancient race of cold-blooded reptilians said to be the first and oldest civilisation. Alien, enigmatic, and entirely without mercy, the Lizardmen were there at the start of all things and will be there when the world draws its last dying breath, never tiring nor relenting until order is finally restored to this uncaring, chaotic world.\\n\\nFrom the primeval jungles of Lustria they come, disciplined cohorts of Saurian warriors with giant scaly beasts in their midst, led by the most powerful Sorcerers the world has ever seen. The ground trembles from their approach. They go to battle for reasons indecipherable to others – an ancient plan known only to themselves.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh2_main_rogue	placeholder	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh2_main_skv_skaven	The Skaven are a cunning and diabolical race of scuttering humanoid rat-creatures that have spread their loathsome corruption to the farthest corners of the world. From deep below the ground, these scavengers have built a vast Under-Empire, whose military power and incomprehensible numbers has the potential to smother the kingdoms of the Old World in a seething tide of violence and anarchy.\\n\\nThey follow the malevolent deity known as the Horned Rat, whose wishes and demands are both supreme and absolute. It is said that the ultimate goal of the Skaven is to conquer the surface world and bring about the Great Ascendancy, whence the Horned Rat's children will swarm across its face and claim all of it as their own.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_chaos_dwarfs	Malign, dark-souled and merciless, Chaos Dwarfs are known in legend as a warrior race of Daemonsmiths, craftsmen and brutal killers who have dominated the northern reaches of the Dark Lands for thousands of years.\\n\\nLong separated from their fading kin of the west, the Dawi-Zharr have given themselves over to their dark master Hashut and allowed Chaos to work its twisted terrors on their minds and souls, transforming them into a calculatingly cruel reflection of what they once were. They are deeply learned in the sorcerous arts and obsessed with the control of hellish forces and fires of the deep earth, combining dark lore with artisanship and skill for metalwork and industry. Thus, the Chaos Dwarfs have produced a bewildering variety of strange and infernal war engines, Daemon-bound weapons and deadly tools of war, and their power grows still.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_cth_cathay	Past the Mountains of Mourn and the steppes beyond lies the fabled empire of Cathay. Travellers returning from the eastern reaches tell tales of jade cities and golden pagodas. They recount strange creatures from serpentine Dragons to monolithic stone sentinels, and flying Sky-Junks that rain multi-hued firepower from up above. But most of all they tell of the imposing and disciplined armies that march forth in defence of their kingdom – the thousands of devoted foot soldiers, unswerving in their loyalty and unrivalled in the harmonics of war.\\n\\nThat their armies face northwards to garrison the Great Bastion and defend it against the Ruinous Powers is perhaps a blessing, for should the Celestial Dragon Emperor have to turn his legions toward the nations of the west, the threat to all that may be unleashed does not bear thinking about...	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_dae_daemons	Manipulated into a horrifying act by another, the Ungol Prince has given himself up entirely in exchange for the Ruinous blessings of all the Chaos Gods and ascendancy to Daemonhood. The newly arisen Daemon Prince shrugs off his mortal form to take on an ever-changing aspect more pleasing to his new patrons, who continue to war for his ravaged soul.\\n\\nNow, it is the destiny of the Daemon Prince to command the legions of Chaos Undivided in waging eternal war against entire nations and immortal rivals, as he seeks a terrible vengeance on sovereigns and even gods. Will he claim the Mark of one master or forge a path that will bring him to utter domination, which even the Dark Powers will struggle to harness?	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_kho_khorne	Khorne, the Blood God, rages upon his brass throne, resting atop a mountain of skulls, built from the countless heads of the great champions his followers have slain over an immeasurable number of aeons. He cares not from where blood flows so long as it is done in his name. It is not uncommon to see the warriors of Khorne fighting amongst themselves, battling to prove their skill in combat and rise higher in the eyes of their wrathful master.\\n\\nTo follow Khorne is to embrace violence and destruction, and to pledge utter subservience to his cause. Khorne's most favoured servants are gifted with immense powers. Some may even ascend to Daemonhood, and it is these chosen few who are tasked with bringing his wrath down upon the world. Blood for the Blood God!	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_ksl_kislev	The Tzardom of Kislev, known as the Realm of the Ice Queen, is the most northerly civilisation within the Old World, a powerful and war-driven country. The inhabitants of Kislev are wolf-tough and self-reliant warriors, valiant and determined in the defence of their Motherland, for they are the bulwark against the horrors of the north.\\n\\nSince its founding, Kislev has been under constant assault by the hordes of Chaos. Countless generations of Kislevites have fought and died in the snowy tundra of those harsh northern oblasts, and it is thanks to these brave Kislevite warriors that mankind has managed to flourish in the south, huddled together in their warm, safe homes, whilst the sons and daughters of Kislev fight on until they draw their dying breaths.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_nur_nurgle	Nurgle, also known as the Plague Lord, is the Chaos God of disease, decay, death and degradation. He is perhaps the oldest of his brother Gods, for the process of decay began with life. Yet Nurgle is also the personification of rebirth. After all, atrophy is simply one part of life's cycle, without which nothing new can grow.\\n\\nAnd so those who embrace Nurgle, accept their own doom with good humour. Disfigured by disease and mutation, they are keen to spread Grandfather's blessings to the poor souls that wander through life unafflicted. As plagues spread, so to does Nurgle's power and status amongst his brothers – he waxes and wanes, weakest when bellies are full and mortals are healthy, but quickly rising to absolute ascendancy when his followers unleash the most lethal of diseases.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_ogr_ogre_kingdoms	Ogres are a race of large humanoids, tough, vicious and always hungry. Semi-nomadic in nature, wandering Ogre tribes can be found wrecking their way across the known world, yet no matter how far away they may be, all Ogres consider the scattered tribal kingdoms that dominate the slopes and river valleys of the Mountains of Mourn to be their rightful, hard-earned homeland.\\n\\nThey fight as thugs, bandits and mercenaries, picking on the strong and the weak alike, battling mighty foes and powerful kingdoms thousands of leagues away. They do this for the alluring promise of gold, plunder and, most importantly, meat, for their endless destruction and looting serves only to appease their gluttonous appetites and their ever-hungry god, the Great Maw.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_pro_ksl_kislev	placeholder	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_sla_slaanesh	Slaanesh is dedicated to the pursuit of excess, gratification, hedonism, pain and amoral pleasure at the expense of any other soul. He is the youngest of the Chaos Gods, for the complex emotions of erotic desire and decadence only exist within the minds of intelligent races. From within the Realm of Chaos, the Dark Prince revels in each new sensation discovered. He guides the mortal inhabitants laden with desire to go ever further in their pursuit of stimulation.\\n\\nThose who serve Slaanesh are consumed by their own dark passions, driven by the need for their mistress-master’s approval to commit more sordid atrocities. And so Slaanesh's followers practice war upon the nations of the south, seducing their foes into the service of their Dark God and inflicting symphonies of misery upon those who resist his call.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh3_main_tze_tzeentch	Tzeentch – the Changer of the Ways – is the Chaos God of magic, evolution, manipulation and trickery. He is flux incarnate – the God who truly embodies the endless, broiling change that is Chaos. It is Tzeentch above all who holds the terrible knowledge of fate and destiny in his talons. His worshippers are desperate to share in such lore but are merely pawns in the Great Game; another piece to move on the board and outplay the other Chaos Gods.\\n\\nTo serve Tzeentch is to invite insanity. His servants weave their own complex webs of influence and manipulation, founding cults in high society as well as armed legions of puppet-followers. They pay no mind to the fact that their master views such plots as mere petty distractions, for the Architect of Fate's own design is aeons in the making.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_dlc03_bst_beastmen	Deep within the dark twisted forests of the Old World range the Beastmen, a race of savage mutants that bear various traits of bestial appearance. Beastmen are creatures of Chaos. They follow the Ruinous Powers, so civilisation is anathema to them; they tear down progress and society wherever it is found. And so they raid, destroying hamlets, villages and even towns that dare to exist close to their blood-grounds.\\n\\nYet should a brayherd be gathered, then even mankind's cities are under threat, for the Beastmen go to war with savage intent, slaughtering civilised races like cattle, burning down and shattering their homes, and stomping on the remains with their cloven hooves until there is nothing left but devastation and ruin.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_dlc05_wef_wood_elves	The Wood Elves – or Asrai – are the guardians of Athel Loren, the most ancient forest in the Old World. They are a reclusive and mysterious race who rarely emerge from the forest and are generally only seen when coming to its defence. Although they can appear cruel or capricious, in reality the Asrai are a neutral power who act only to maintain the balance of their environment.\\n\\nIt is this cause for which they fight, for no land remains untarnished long if it cannot take up arms against those that wish it harm. The waking woodlands of Athel Loren have endured for many thousands of years, so long as the watchful eyes of her protectors continue their loyal vigilance.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_dlc08_nor_norsca		false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_main_brt_bretonnia	Bretonnia is a feudal society, split between the rich nobles with their gallant Knights and the lowly peasant class toiling in the fields. The Knights of Bretonnia – the flower of its military – have a code of chivalry that forms an unbreakable duty to protect its subjects, and when called to war, are considered by many to be the most powerful heavy cavalry in the Old World. However, a Bretonnian army rarely consists of Knights alone, and so ranks of solid, if unremarkable, foot troops and peasant levies are provided to soak up damage from unchivalrous cannons and other ranged devices.\\n\\nSo it is that in times of need the Knights of Bretonnia ride forth with lances dipped, and a prayer to the Lady on their lips!	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_main_chs_chaos	Chaos Warriors are mortals who have left their natural way of life and chosen to dedicate themselves to a Chaos God in order to gain their favour, with the ultimate goal of Daemonhood and eternal life. They are the chosen servants of Chaos who live for nothing more than spreading terror and death to those weaker than themselves, gathering about them northern tribes of vicious marauders, desperate to despoil the lands of milk and honey to the south.\\n\\nAnd so from the icy fjords of Norsca and the blasted Chaos Wastes beyond, the innumerable armies of Chaos surge southward, either raiding across the icy seas in longships or marching inland to wreak crimson destruction upon the cities and strongholds of the Old World.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_main_dwf_dwarfs	Dwarfs are a proud, bearded folk who are quick to temper, often defined by a love of gems, gold and other precious metals. With their Dwarfholds established across the Old World, the Dawi – as they call themselves in Khazalid – prospered for many generations until their realm was riven by a chain of devastating conflicts and earthquakes.\\n\\nIn recent times, the Dwarfs are a race barely holding onto glories past, with only a few strongholds remaining in their hands and the rest lost to enemies or abandoned to the elements. To this day the Dawi still fight; their ultimate goal is to restore the 'Karaz Ankor' and they have the means to do it with fearsome throngs of warriors and the most advanced weaponry in the Old World.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_main_emp_empire	Lying at the heart of the Old World, the Empire is the greatest and most powerful of all the kingdoms forged by men. But it is a realm in constant turmoil, both from enemies without and strife from within as rival Elector Counts vie for the throne. Whether fighting between themselves or the many exterior invaders, the greatest nation of man can muster a formidable army of disciplined warriors, magic, steam-powered wonders and menageries of fantastical beasts.\\n\\nNow, the Twin-Tailed Comet blazes across the sky once again and a new Emperor has been crowned – surely an omen that the time has come to unite the Empire, secure its borders and bring prosperity to its beleaguered citizens.	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_main_grn_greenskins	Orcs and Goblins are the scourge of the Old World. Orcs are built for violence; Goblins, by contrast, are smaller but more cunning. Collectively known as Greenskins, they are an aggressive and brutal race with an unquenchable love of fighting. While the Greenskins have made lairs in ransacked Dwarfholds, they can be found across the Old World – the majority residing in the arid Badlands, mainly fighting amongst themselves and only coming together when the call to Waaagh! goes out.\\n\\nOne such occasion is now, and with a strong Warboss to unite the tribes, the time has surely come to unleash da Green Tide and ravage the lands of both humies and stunties alike! For such are the demands of Gork and Mork – and who would go against the word of da Green Godz? Exactly. Waaagh!	false
cultures_frontend_description_wh_main_vmp_vampire_counts	Long ago, Queen Neferata stole the secrets of eternal life from Nagash. The elixir she created was flawed, bestowing immortality but at great cost. And so the Vampires were created and they have been a plague upon the living ever since.\\n\\nMillennia later, the darkling figure of Vlad von Carstein arrived in Sylvania – before long, the region's destitute nobility were in his thrall and the von Carstein bloodline was born. Every few centuries, a von Carstein would take the reins of power and strike out against mortals at the head of an Unliving army of zombies, wraiths, Necromancers and other abyssal monstrosities.\\n\\n The Empire has thwarted such legions before, but the dead have never rested easily in Sylvania and now they lurch from their graves, summoned to Unlife by the Midnight Aristocracy as each prepares to challenge mankind once more.	false
