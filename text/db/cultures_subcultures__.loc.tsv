cultures_subcultures_battle_playstyle_description_wh2_dlc09_sc_tmb_tomb_kings	Fielding Legions of skeleton infantry, archers and chariots, in combination with monstrous animated constructs, the Tomb Kings overwhelm the foe with resilience and numbers. The Realm of Souls means that as more friendly units are destroyed, the Tomb Kings gain army-wide heals and eventually a powerful Ushabti summoned through the Realm of Souls system.	false
cultures_subcultures_battle_playstyle_description_wh2_dlc11_sc_cst_vampire_coast	Focusing on hordes of gunpowder-armed zombie pirates, the forces of the Vampire Coast specialize in blocking their enemy with powerful monsters so they can blast them off the field with missile and artillery units.

cultures_subcultures_battle_playstyle_description_wh2_main_sc_def_dark_elves	Dark Elf armies are well-rounded, able to field armour-piercing missile units, line-breaking heavy cavalry, and elite infantry.

cultures_subcultures_battle_playstyle_description_wh3_dlc23_sc_chd_chaos_dwarfs	Chaos Dwarf armies are highly flexible and wear many hats. A heavily-armoured, fire-resistant frontline is bolstered by a cheap caste of Labourers and Hobgoblin lackeys that serve as a bulwark for powerful gunpowder weaponry and long-range artillery trains. This flexibility is further augmented by powerful bound fire Daemons, flying monsters and even cavalry. All of this flexibility comes at a cost though, making the right combination of units the key to victory.	false

cultures_subcultures_battle_playstyle_description_wh_main_sc_brt_bretonnia	Bretonnia specialises in riding down their foes with powerful heavy cavalry. Supported by copious amounts of expendable peasant infantry and archers, these units buy time and space for the mounted Knights to charge, fall back and charge once more.	false

cultures_subcultures_battle_playstyle_description_wh_main_sc_dwf_dwarfs	The Dwarfs rely on steadfast, heavily-armoured infantry supported by powerful artillery and missile units.
