cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_1	This broth looks like an unappetizing mess. Is that a wing, a foot, a drumstick? Or maybe even something’s head? The less you know, the better!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_10	Putrid slime? Poisonous-looking mushrooms? What's not to like? Except the resulting flatulence, of course.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_2	The bones and claws of flyin' gubbinz make good skewers for fishy chunks, as fishbones do for flyin' gubbinz. Hard to tell what’s what, though…	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_3	With a few ‘shrooms and nondescript flyin’ gubbinz, anyone can make something that vaguely resembles a stew. Whether it tastes like what it's claimed to be is another thing.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_4	Mince up some exotic meats, be it bat, Dragon, or whatever, and serve it up with the most disgusting sauce imaginable – just how Grom likes it.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_5	Wholly unidentifiable pieces of meat and fish slapped on a plate make for an easily prepared flavour-filled meal! It's like a beach party in your mouth, but everyone's throwing up.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_6	Nothing says ‘dinner’ to Grom like animal guts, giblets, and meaty fodder stuffed into some intestines, with some random 'shrooms tossed in for good measure.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_7	Grom's own spin on that timeless Tilean recipe is not for the faint-hearted. A vegetarian might die just by looking at it.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_8	In Marienburg, they like to put pieces of meat between Halfling bread, but Grom much prefers his fishy mushroom version. And the rottener the fish, the better!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_9	Every gobbo loves a good quiche, though they've lost the knowledge of what a quiche actually is. Not that they care, as long as it smells worse than a Troll Hag’s tunic.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_1	No-one really knows how this ethereal dish was created. It’s hard to kill something that’s already dead. It’s even harder to make it taste like anything!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_2	It's said that a Bretonnian peasant once serendipitously caught a stray eagle from Ulthuan that he force-fed to death; he found its liver particularly tasty!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_3	Shamans often tried intoxicating recipes to enable them to ‘talk’ to Gork or Mork, eventually discovering that this particular dish tasted much better than it made them feel.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_4	Some dishes sound humble but are riskier to make than Squig herding. Someone needs to enter a Arachnarok’s lair and steal its freshly laid eggs.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_5	If the stunties knew what the gobbos were doing with their beloved brew, there'd be another entry in the Book of Grudges. They know nothing – Dwarf food tastes like Troll snot anyway!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_agonys_succession	The floating skull fragments add a tinge of horror to this deadly concoction, perfect for all your cursed needs.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_bears_bulwark	A potent scent spreads with every whisper, strong enough to knock a man from his feet.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_craven_scent	One can only hope it is meant to look and smell this bad…	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_deadeyes_sting	It has an odour like something died in it, but at least it helps sharpen the senses! Unfortunately, that includes the sense of smell…	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_ember_dread	Beware: this potion is blistering to the touch and even hotter on the tongue.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_entropous	Simply staring long enough into this dense, viscous concoction is enough to sap the strength from one's bones.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_fragmentii	A single drop of such a mixture induces weakness, tainting all it touches with fragility.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_frostwyverns_toil	The cauldron borders on freezing, exuding a chill suited to the deepest winter.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_gait_of_thorns	Every word has a bite to it, uttered over bubbling liquid sure to sting the skin.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_hags_denial	Such a spell is sure to get the heart pounding, and oddly enough, leaves an earthy taste on the tongue.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_harrowing_coil	One could hear the faint screaming of trapped souls with every chant… Perhaps it's just in the imagination?	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_hushed_cast	Every word of the incantation is quieter than the last, until the whispers can barely be heard above the bubbling of the cauldron. 	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_incarnates_wrath	Every ingredient is imbued with the strength of the forest, combining to create an empowering incantation, brimming with nature's might.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_inversus	The hex isn't too disturbing, if one can look past the ominous chanting and the lingering stench of death.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_leshys_embrace	It may look like a grotesque, swirling mix of animal bones, but paired with the right words, it does wonders on the battlefield.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_rats_grit	That's the thing about rats... they always survive, endlessly scurrying towards safety.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_spectres_miasma	You'd best start believing in ghost stories…	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_spirited_away	Communing with the spirits of the forest has always been a dangerous business, but the prize…	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_typhlosis	Vision is the most fragile of the senses, easily stolen by a simple spell or toxic brew.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_unburdened_step	An enchanted elixir, promised to rid you of your burdens and ease every worry.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_whiff_of_madness	We all go a little… off-kilter sometimes… right?	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh3_dlc24_recipe_wraith_sight	If one looks into the cauldron long enough, the deathly image of a skull looks back, moulded into shape by toxic bubbles.	false
