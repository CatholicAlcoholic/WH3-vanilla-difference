cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_1	This broth looks like an unappetizing mess. Is that a wing, a foot, a drumstick? Or maybe even something’s head? The less you know, the better!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_10	Putrid slime? Poisonous-looking mushrooms? What's not to like? Except the resulting flatulence, of course.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_2	The bones and claws of flyin' gubbinz make good skewers for fishy chunks, as fishbones do for flyin' gubbinz. Hard to tell what’s what, though…	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_3	With a few ‘shrooms and nondescript flyin’ gubbinz, anyone can make something that vaguely resembles a stew. Whether it tastes like what it's claimed to be is another thing.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_4	Mince up some exotic meats, be it bat, Dragon, or whatever, and serve it up with the most disgusting sauce imaginable – just how Grom likes it.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_5	Wholly unidentifiable pieces of meat and fish slapped on a plate make for an easily prepared flavour-filled meal! It's like a beach party in your mouth, but everyone's throwing up.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_6	Nothing says ‘dinner’ to Grom like animal guts, giblets, and meaty fodder stuffed into some intestines, with some random 'shrooms tossed in for good measure.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_7	Grom's own spin on that timeless Tilean recipe is not for the faint-hearted. A vegetarian might die just by looking at it.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_8	In Marienburg, they like to put pieces of meat between Halfling bread, but Grom much prefers his fishy mushroom version. And the rottener the fish, the better!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_dish_9	Every gobbo loves a good quiche, though they've lost the knowledge of what a quiche actually is. Not that they care, as long as it smells worse than a Troll Hag’s tunic.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_1	No-one really knows how this ethereal dish was created. It’s hard to kill something that’s already dead. It’s even harder to make it taste like anything!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_2	It's said that a Bretonnian peasant once serendipitously caught a stray eagle from Ulthuan that he force-fed to death; he found its liver particularly tasty!	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_3	Shamans often tried intoxicating recipes to enable them to ‘talk’ to Gork or Mork, eventually discovering that this particular dish tasted much better than it made them feel.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_4	Some dishes sound humble but are riskier to make than Squig herding. Someone needs to enter a Arachnarok’s lair and steal its freshly laid eggs.	false
cooking_recipes_flavour_text_wh2_dlc15_food_special_dish_5	If the stunties knew what the gobbos were doing with their beloved brew, there'd be another entry in the Book of Grudges. They know nothing – Dwarf food tastes like Troll snot anyway!	false
