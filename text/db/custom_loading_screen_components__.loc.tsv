custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc20_chs_azazelcustom_quote	It is said that Azazel’s beauty is second only to that of Slaanesh himself, and those who gaze upon him cannot gainsay such claims. As the Prince of Damnation prowls the mortal plane, his arrival is met by the usual fanfare he has become accustomed to, the barbarians of the Steppes fling themselves at his feet as they wail and proclaim their allegiance and love. Yet this time the world must take heed, for the darkling monster’s appearance is a portent most dire. Deep within the psyche of the other three Powers has always lurked the suspicion that Slaanesh’s influence could one day eclipse them all. By the might of His Ecstatic Legions, that day is nigh.	false

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc20_chs_festuscustom_quote	From the day Doctor Festus’ brilliant mortal mind suffered its horrific awakening, the vagaries of fate had oft twisted in his favour. Never is the Leechlord happier than when planting Nurgle’s seeds of malady across the world, force-feeding his vile experimental concoctions to the many unfortunates who stray into his path. Yet soon shall be the dawn of a far greater opportunity for mass infection; the unleashing of a dark power so great, it shall be thirsted after by the Gods themselves. A means for the Doctor and his Patron to spread unbound life – and death – into the material realm on an unimaginable scale.	false

And now the Consort of Khorne comes to blight the mortal plane once again, this time her coming foretold many years in advance by tribal shamans, with the iconic and primitive etchings of the winged warrior-queen long adorning the walls of hermit grottos across the north. As the world teeters on the precipice of epochal events, Khorne’s bloodlust crescendos once more, His violent whims, as ever, to be served unquestioningly by the inimitable Gorequeen.	false

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc20_chs_vilitchcustom_quote	What is the true purpose of those who serve within Tzeentch’s schemes? The answer eludes Vilitch the Curseling no less than his Master’s other puppets. Legitimised long ago as a horribly remarkable agent of Change by the Great Conspirator himself, the disturbing creature known as the Twisted Twin acts with inscrutable intent, leading his hard-bitten host through warpaths of misrule, disorder and death. As the fate of a lesser god draws to its conclusion, the Sorcerer-runt is soon to turn his attention back north, where broils something ancient and potent deep within the Wastes. Most importantly, a rare chance to secure favour in the eyes of his master and perhaps never be forsaken again…	false

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc20_survival_altar_of_battle_outrocustom_quote	A champion rises, chief among the armies of Ruin! With all challengers vanquished, and the souls of Zanbaijin claimed, a true paragon of Chaos has emerged. There is surely now no force in any realm capable of barring the path to total domination!

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc23_chd_astragothcustom_quote	The name Astragoth Ironhand is legendary amongst the Dhrath-Zharr, powerful, loyal and zealous acolytes of Hashut. But that was many years ago, and the rigors of time and Dark Magic hardened the Sorcerer-Prophet’s limbs until they turned to stone. Not resigned to becoming a statue, he forged a suit of machinery in which to continue his work.\\n\\nCarried by his own designs and dark intellect, Astragoth Ironhand now travels freely, relying on his own twisted science and construction to convey him.\\n\\nUpstarts may now see him as a fossil, a remnant embedded in stone and well beyond his prime, but Astragoth’s time is not yet over! Age and petrification are mere obstacles to overcome, and with the fabled Blood of Hashut, this domination will be secured!	false

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc23_chd_legion_of_azgorhcustom_quote	In his youth, the fearsome Daemonsmith Drazhoath lost favour amongst the Sorcerer-Prophets, a victim of the savage politics of Zharr-Naggrund. For this, he was exiled from the heart of the Chaos Dwarf empire to the Black Fortress, in the distant reaches south of the Mountains of Mourn.\\n\\nDrazhoath has since risen to become Lord of the Black Fortress and Commander of the Legion of Azgorh from his border citadel near the banks of the mighty River Ruin. Looking again to the Tower of Fire, he seeks revenge against those that exiled him.\\n\\nA method for Drazhoath the Ashen to return home now presents itself, not as a penitent pilgrim, but as the rightful and irrefutably brutal Lord of Zharr-Naggrund.	false

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc23_chd_zhatancustom_quote	Ghorth the Cruel, Sorcerer-Prophet of Zharr-Naggrund, demands much from his generals. Fresh Labourers are required daily to meet the harsh demands of the Chaos Dwarf’s vast factory forges. No Dhrath-Zharr would accept this task more gladly, or with darker, even crueller glee, than Zhatan the Black, Commander of the Tower of Zharr.\\n\\nA call from Ghorth for even greater harvests reaches Zhatan; rumblings of a new venture are heard. The challenge is welcomed: new lands will be conquered for the glory of Hashut and Ghorth, and the weak will be inevitably subsumed.\\n\\nThe screams of the weak will echo throughout the forges, and the ecstatic laughs of Zhatan shall ring out all the louder!	false

But now, the time for overt action is at hand. The Dragon Emperor himself has tasked Yuan Bo with fulfilling a centuries-long scheme to ensure Cathay’s prominence. This must be attended to personally. No other faithful servant of the Dragon Emperor can be trusted with this undertaking.\\n\\nAnd so, Yuan Bo must step out from the shadows and take to the field. With the accumulated knowledge of the Jade Court, Yuan Bo seeks to realign the Celestial Compass, and secure the safety of Grand Cathay from all dangers, either within or without.	false

Yet the reality is far more horrifying than any child could conceive, for the old crone spoken about in such tales is no mere myth.\\n\\nMother Ostankya, an elusive figure empowered by the land itself, draws her terrifying magic from woodland, fen and oblast alike. Those with transgressions against the Motherland, be they of this world or another, find no refuge from her vengeance, even on their own soil.\\n\\nTo the distant north, where stands Kislev’s abandoned watchtowers against the Ruinous incursions, she brings her wrath. There can be no doubt: her appearance so far from home is a portent of terrible curses soon to come.\\n\\n[[i]]Mother Ostankya will get you![[/i]]	false

custom_loading_screen_components_localised_text_wh3_dlc24_tze_the_deceiverscustom_quote	An eternity of meddling in the Chaos Realm inevitably led Tzeentch’s brother-Gods to vie for the Changeling’s destruction.\\n\\nFor it was the Changeling who cut away Slaanesh’s hair as the Dark Prince slept to weave a cloak presented to a champion of Tzeentch. It was the Changeling who sealed the doors of Khorne’s citadel while he was campaigning, forcing the Blood God to shatter his own proud gates when he returned.\\n\\nYet it is the Daemon’s boredom with such inanities of the Great Game, rather than the ire of the Chaos Realm, that leads him to the Old World to seek greater tapestries of disruption. By the time the deceiving horror becomes known to his victims, be they kings, emperors, or even gods, they will be impotent to act against him.	false

Ejected from the Engineers' Guild, the eager inventor plies his trade as a sworn Slayer, hoping his work can be of some use until he finds redemption in glorious sacrifice.\\n\\nYet, as the oncoming tides of Chaos threaten to swallow the world whole, his noble demise may lie just beyond the horizon. Aboard the Spirit of Grungni – an Airship of his own design – he traverses the skies, honour-bound to defend the Dwarfholds with his most deadly creations.\\n\\nFor now, Makaisson's calling draws him onwards.

Now, legend sits on the verge of reality. Tamurkhan, the great Kurgan Lord of Chaos, has declared himself the fabled Bringer of Desolation, seeking to lead the virulent war hosts of Nurgle in a sweeping tide of rot.\\n\\nBurrowed deep in the body of an Ogre Tyrant, he puppets his hideous host with the blessing of the Urfather, riding before his great horde to spread death and destruction in abundance. The misguided pawns of lesser Gods will no doubt try to stand in his way – a mistake the Maggot Lord will make sure to punish severely!	false

It is the Time of Darkness and Disharmony. Unrest is rife. Your siblings look to their own affairs, caring not that the hordes of Chaos mass just beyond the Great Bastion. But even on this side of the barrier the cults of Chi’an Chi foster dissention. The coming conflict will be difficult without aid, so perhaps the Ogres will side with you for a large fee? Or maybe your younger brother, the Iron Dragon, can be convinced to send the legions of Shang-yang? Harmony must be restored… and soon… or Grand Cathay will fall.	false

To aid his rule, he took a mate, the Moon Dragon, and they had nine children who became noble rulers of Cathay's many provinces.\\n\\nOf the nine, four have been lost to time and enmity. Miao Ying, the Storm Dragon, was the first-born, given the honour of ruling the Northern Provinces and charged with Cathay's defence as commander of the Great Bastion. But the predations of Chaos grow, the bastion is under strain.\\n\\nThe power of a god may aid in securing Cathay's borders.

Throughout the cavernous courts of Nuln are whispers of one who exists within this nebulous realm of reality, regarded as an inhuman spectre of Unlife.\\n\\nElspeth von Draken, Magisterix of the Amethyst Order, steeps herself in Shyish and the mastery of the Lore of Death. Though many shun the wielders of the deathly arts, the “Graveyard Rose” is unquestioned in her steadfast defence of the Empire.\\n\\nHeeding her warnings of evil on the horizon, the Elector Countess of Wissenland has granted the pallid Sorceress access to the renowned might of the Imperial Gunnery School. Whether by her command of magic or the lethal guns of Nuln, the Empire’s enemies shall be granted death everlasting!	false
