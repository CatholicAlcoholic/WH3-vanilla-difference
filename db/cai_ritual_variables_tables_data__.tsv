minor_ritual_cast_max_rounds	The min and max bounds are scaled linearly between min and max by difficulty level. e.g. if min= 0, max = 12, then in the hardest difficulty, a minor ritual will be cast in every [0,..,2] turn.	25.0
minor_ritual_cast_min_rounds	The min and max bounds are scaled linearly between min and max by difficulty level. e.g. if min= 0, max = 12, then in the hardest difficulty, a minor ritual will be cast in every [0,..,2] turn.	5.0
vortex_interruption_chance_base	Base value for the vortex interruption chance formula	-50.0
vortex_interruption_chance_bounds_max	Used as the max bound in vortex interruption chance formula	95.0
vortex_interruption_chance_bounds_min	Used as the min bound in vortex interruption chance formula	5.0
vortex_interruption_chance_difficulty_level_max_contribution	Difficulty level. Note: if the target is an AI faction, the difficulty level it he opposite of the player’s difficulty! (so if it’s legendary for the player, it’s easy for AI)	40.0
vortex_interruption_chance_difficulty_level_min_contribution	Difficulty level. Note: if the target is an AI faction, the difficulty level it he opposite of the player’s difficulty! (so if it’s legendary for the player, it’s easy for AI)	0.0
vortex_interruption_chance_endpoint_multiplier	A modifier on the intervention chance (the longer ago was the vortex ritual started, the less chance AI will interrupt (should be between 0 and 1), if it is 0, ai wont interrupt. if 0.5, it wont interrupt after the half way through 	0.5
vortex_interruption_chance_others_already_cast_max_contribution	Target faction has recently (within 10 rounds) been interrupted by others maximum  in vortex interruption chance formula	25.0
vortex_interruption_chance_others_already_cast_min_contribution	Target faction has recently (within 10 rounds) been interrupted by others minimum  in vortex interruption chance formula	0.0
vortex_interruption_chance_player_multiplier	If the target is the player, apply multiplier  in vortex interruption chance formula	2.0
vortex_interruption_chance_progress_of_target_max_contribution	Target faction’s ritual progress  maximum in vortex interruption chance formula. The higher the level, the bigger the chance it’ll get interrupted. 	30.0
vortex_interruption_chance_progress_of_target_min_contribution	Target faction’s ritual progress  minimum in vortex interruption chance formula. The higher the level, the bigger the chance it’ll get interrupted,	0.0
vortex_interruption_chance_recently_cast_max_contribution	AI faction recently casted an interruption on someone maximum  in vortex interruption chance formula	15.0
vortex_interruption_chance_recently_cast_min_contribution	AI faction recently casted an interruption on someone minimum  in vortex interruption chance formula	0.0
vortex_interruption_chance_recently_cast_rounds	AI faction recently casted an interruption on someone, round threshold  in vortex interruption chance formula	10.0
vortex_interruption_war_bonus_max	Max bonus to war declaration value, scales with intervention chance.	30.0
vortex_interruption_war_bonus_min	Min bonus to war declaration value, scales with intervention chance.	0.0
vortex_ritual_cast_max_rounds	The min and max bounds are scaled linearly between min and max by difficulty level. e.g. if min= 0, max = 12, then in the hardest difficulty, a vortex ritual will be cast following the idle of in every [0,..,12] turn.	15.0
vortex_ritual_cast_min_rounds	The min and max bounds are scaled linearly between min and max by difficulty level. e.g. if min= 0, max = 12, then in the hardest difficulty, a vortex ritual will be cast following the idle of in every [0,..,12] turn.	5.0
vortex_ritual_minimum_defence_army_size_in_units	When determining potential defensive armies before casting a vortex ritual, the minimum size in units those armies must be to be counted as relevant.	7.0
vortex_ritual_omit_defendability_after_rounds	Ignore the defendibility check if we havent cast any ritual for this many rounds	40.0
