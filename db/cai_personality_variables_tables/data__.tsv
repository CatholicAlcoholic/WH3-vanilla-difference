ai_military_generator_size_penalty_multiplier	 0.1	(In-game) Multiplier for the military force size penalty. The higher the more penalty is applied.
ai_threat_score_attitude_multiplier_max	3	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_attitude_multiplier_min	0.1	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_attitude_threshold_max	150	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_attitude_threshold_min	-150	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_direct_actions_mult_max	1	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_direct_actions_mult_min	0.5	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_personality_multiplier_player	1.0	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_proximity_multiplier_max	1	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
ai_threat_score_proximity_multiplier_min	0.25	(In-game) Used for figuring out the common threat in diplomacy calculations
allied_recruitment_favour_max	50	(In-game) When performing allied recruitment, we must have more than X favour points with the ally, where X is a random number between CAI_VARIABLE_ALLIED_RECRUITMENT_FAVOUR_MIN and this.
allied_recruitment_favour_min	25	(In-game) When performing allied recruitment, we must have more than X favour points with the ally, where X is a random number between this and CAI_VARIABLE_ALLIED_RECRUITMENT_FAVOUR_MAX.
caravans_cargo_increments	100	(In-game) Cargo value will be rounded down to this increment: i.e 100 means that the AI can send cargos with a value of 100, 200, 300...
caravans_maximum_cargo	2000	(In-game) The maximum cargo value that the AI will send a caravan with.
caravans_maximum_cargo_as_proportion_of_treasury	0.5	(In-game) The maximum proportion of their treasury that the AI will send a caravan with.
caravans_minimum_cargo	200	(In-game) The minimum cargo value that the AI will send a caravan with.
coordinator_major_faction_strength_bonus	1.2	(In-game) Multiplier for strength of major factions.
coordinator_player_loss_multiplier	1	(In-game) Multiplier for score contribution of player's losses.
coordinator_player_strength_multiplier	1	(In-game) Multiplier for strength of player factions.
diplomacy_deal_evaluation_long_distance_threshold_max	1	(In-game) At this proportion of the distance that's specified by CAI_VARIABLE_DIPLOMACY_DISTANCE_GOAL_PRIORITY_MODIFIER, we apply the maximum amount of deal evaluation penalty (long_distance_penalty_max)
diplomacy_deal_evaluation_long_distance_threshold_min	0.05	(In-game) Starting from this proportion of the distance that's specified by CAI_VARIABLE_DIPLOMACY_DISTANCE_GOAL_PRIORITY_MODIFIER, we start to apply deal evaluation penalties (long_distance_penalty_min)
diplomacy_distance_goal_priority_modifier	0.3	(In-game) Distance-based modifier for diplomatic goals. The distance is equal to the number of action points it takes to get between the two regions in the map which are furthest away from each over as the crow flies. In IE this is (as of CHD) roughly equal to 132 000. This number is multiplied by the value for this variable to get the maximum distance for AI diplomacy calculations 
max_goal_evaluations	100	(In-game) Maximum number of goals evaluated by this faction per round.
strategic_threat_analysis_maintain_new_main_threat_minimum_number_of_rounds_threshold	5	(In-game) Used in faction strategic threat analysis for specifying how long a 'main threat' should be retained for at a minimum (in number of rounds)
trespassing_warning_compliance_duration	10	(In-game) How many rounds until trespassing_warning_compliance_value hits zero. 
trespassing_warning_compliance_value	50	(In-game) Modifier for trespass analysis scoring when we've agreed to get off of a faction's land. Converges towards 0, in trespassing_warning_compliance_duration rounds.
